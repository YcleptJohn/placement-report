Introduction to my Year in Industry
===================================

During the university selection process, the year in industry programmes
really stood out to me, making it easy to say that I was excited for
this year. It became one of the most pivotal factors in my decision to
turn down King's College London and come to Kent. The placement scheme
sounded so much more fleshed out and enriching here. Having this passion
before I had even made it to the year in the industry really fuelled my
anticipation for the year.

Why Holiday Extras?
-------------------

It's fair to say that before Holiday Extras came to present at the
university I had never heard of them, so what was so enticing? Whilst
it's hard to honestly be excited about selling airport parking; the
role, benefits, and emphasis they placed on their placement program
really stood out. They also told us they only source students from Kent
and that a lot of them had kept graduate positions, meaning that I'd
already be surrounded by people of similar experiences.

Their entire presentation conveyed an image of an extremely relaxed and
fun workplace with all the vibes of a start-up. They boasted about all
the awards they'd received acknowledging them as one of the best places
to work in the UK. They also had current placement students give their
stories and experiences of their placement, all of which told tales of
many learnings and great opportunities at HX.

Whilst all of this was promising I was initially reluctant to settle
into a web-based role. I wasn't completely against the idea but work
closer to the back-end had always interested me more. Due to this I
initially passed up the opportunity and only came back to apply when
applications re-opened. By that time, I had realised that the work
environment, benefits, and opportunities were too good to ignore.

Journey to Holiday Extras
-------------------------

Having come into the placement process with no previous work experience
I was at a complete fresh start without even a CV prepared. Luckily, by
the time it came to my application at HX I'd already sorted out my CV,
sent applications and even had an interview.

### Initial Interviews

The interview was with a company called SquaredUp who are a small
start-up close to my home in London. Whilst it was useful to gain
experience the process also knocked my confidence a little, they asked
some fart-assy questions that put me on the spot more than expected.
However, it also showed me that interviews are a two-way process, from
those questions alone I knew that company was too 'hippy' to be a good
fit for me.

### Application + Interview with HX

After putting in an application to HX I received an invitation to an
assessment day. This day consisted of a group task, presentation, and
individual interview. On the day I remember feeling nervous before
arriving, but the relaxed environment helped me to settle in quickly
once there.

We started with the group task which required us to plan out the
handling of travel disruption caused by snow. We had to plan an email to
customers as well design a system for the call centre to use as a means
of reporting contact with customers. At first this was a little daunting
to be working on with three unknown peers, but I quickly became
distracted in trying to make the best impression possible; engaging with
the group, conversing about ideas, and turning them into a full
solution. When it came time to present our work the calm atmosphere
helped me present confidently and I went to lunch pleased with my
performance so far.

This quiet confidence in my performance so far really helped me going
into the individual interview. In a complete contrast to my experience
with SquaredUp this seemed to go a lot smoother. I didn't feel that many
questions really put me on the spot too much and I was able to be open
about my initial reluctance to a web role. They had many re-assurances
for me that there was enough modern technology in use to keep things
interesting. This made me feel that they really understood where I was
coming from and saw that my focus was on learning as much as possible. I
appreciated what they had to offer in that regard.

I eventually left the day feeling pleased with the impression I'd given
as well as being sure that this type of environment was for me. I began
to realise how much this role would resonate with me despite my initial
feelings.

### Offer from HX

After about a month I received a phone call telling me that HX would
like to offer me the position. I accepted the role then and there
because I'd spent all of the time since the assessment day feeling sure
that it was the right fit for me.

Holiday Extras: a brief overview
--------------------------------

Holiday Extras started its life as the Apple Booking Company (ABC) when
it was founded by Gerry Pack in 1983. It came to fruition when Gerry
noticed a gap in the Airport Hotels market, they had previously been
targeted to business travellers and never towards leisure travellers.
Initially this was achieved through a simple booking platform in
partnership with travel consultants who latched on to the idea; the new
market area provided lucrative and convenient business.

Throughout 35 years of growth and a rebranding as Holiday Extras, the
company's offerings have expanded hugely, and they now specialise in a
vast array of travel products. This includes airport parking, lounges,
insurance, car hire, resort transfers and more. Now having around 800
employees situated across offices in Kent, Germany and Bulgaria it's
fair to say the company has grown with its success.

During those early years the company strived as a platform for travel
agents to make bookings for their own clients, but April 2000 saw the
launch of the HX website. Along with it came the ability for direct
customers to make bookings. This was a large step at the time as most
travel companies were only targeting one market or the other, not both.
Nowadays over 90% of bookings come via the website with less and less
reliance on the call centre for business.

\#\#\# Need to add a description of my objectives for the year or what I

gained more about communication etc)

My Job Role
-----------

When joining my official job title was as an 'Engineer' which kept
things open to interpretation. It was difficult to predict exactly what
that might encompass initially. However, it soon became clear why it was
left open with each team serving different purposes through different
platforms. It was clear there would be many opportunities for me to
learn across all of these different areas, platforms and codebases. I
understood why 'Web Developer' didn't truly fit the bill of this job
despite that being the main throughput.

During my time with HX I managed to gain experience across a variety of
systems and I ended up truly appreciating the fluidity of my role. Not
only did I have the opportunity to work on the front-end of the site,
but my manager actually planned my second team to be a challenging
back-end focused role. This gave me a taste of both worlds and really
helped to push my learning to a higher level, I'm thankful that my own
development was such a focal point for the company.

Working for Holiday Extras
==========================

This section will detail the structure and process of HX as well as how
I feel about my time spent interacting with it as a whole.

Firstly, to pre-face, despite the fact HX has \~800 employees there are
\~150 of us in the actual web team where I've spent all of my time.
Therefore, the majority of what I speak about will be the structure and
process of this web team as a subset of the entire team. This also
affects how much I enjoyed my work at HX, the web team is held on a
pedestal and treated the best out of the business. We're given fun
events, encouraged to attend subsidised conferences and provided the
flexibility do these things. Whilst some roles in the CC only have small
windows of time to actually enjoy what makes us such a "fun start-up".
So yes, *I* am the 1%.

Web Team Structure
------------------

The web team is one of the biggest areas of focus within HX since there
is a direct link to customers and a huge potential to drive growth and
profit. It would be fair to say the work that's done within the web team
has some of the biggest influence on HX's success.

The entire team is split up into smaller sub-teams known as pods, which
were recently renamed to 'teams' but this hasn't caught on yet. Pods
were originally focused around a single area of the business, taking on
all work that relates to that area. For example, the euro pod would pick
up work that would improve the experience for our European customers.
This approach allows each pod to work independently in a self-contained
manner, with cross-pod communication still available for larger
multi-pod projects.

There's also the concept of 'pop-up pods' which would be created to
achieve shorter term goals that either, didn't fit into a single pod or
needed multi-disciplined engineers to achieve. A good example of this is
the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) pod, which started when we
had \<40 days to fix something which Google would detract our SEO
rankings for.

Within the last few months of my placement the company began making a
shift towards 'mission-based' pods. The intention of this was that pods
would spawn dynamically around missions that the company wanted to
achieve. This makes the pods much more reactive and allows fluidity with
the assignment of engineers to missions that they suit best.

I personally have remained within a pod that isn't truly mission based
so I've not experienced it first-hand but it sounds like a sensible
approach.

Pod Structure
-------------

As much as the web team is built of pods each pod contains a concoction
of roles that make the pod successful. The exact structure varies
per-pod, but most pods contain a few engineers, a software tester, an
agile coach and a product owner.

**Engineers**

The engineers within a pod are one of the main workhorses. They spend
the majority of their time writing code to actually implement new
features or fix issues. They're also involved within the planning of
work by helping use their experience to estimate the difficulty or time
investment of certain pieces of work.

**Software Testers**

The testers within a pod are responsible for testing the work
implemented by the engineers, they will ensure it works as expected in a
variety of environments and scenarios. This is especially important
within HX's complex systems as there are often use cases that engineers
might not have considered. Testers also typically offer a huge wealth of
knowledge about the business and the complexity of all systems combined.

**Agile Coach (AC)**

The agile coach within a pod typically manages the workflow of the pod
on a day-to-day basis. They will ensure that the agile process
([detailed in 2.3](#Agile Process)) is followed and that everyone can
achieve what they've set out without issue.

The agile coach within a pod manages the workflow of a pod on a
day-to-day basis. Ensuring that everyone in the team can work
efficiently and effectively together without being affected by blockers
on their work.

**Product Owner (PO)**

The product owners are responsible for managing relations with
stakeholders, communicating and setting goals for the pod. This ensures
the work being done suits the business and stakeholders' needs.

Each of these roles play a vital part of each pod at HX and when
combined they form a strong core structure for the pod to thrive off of.

Agile Process
-------------

Every pod within the web team uses an agile approach which aims to
deliver work quickly in an incremental pattern. This has become common
within technology where the flaws of older methodologies, like the
waterfall model, have been highlighted by the adaptive and reactive
nature of modern technology.

### Sprint Structure

At HX this process manifests as bi-monthly sprints which aim to be a
self-enclosed two-week section of work.

{{{{{ Sprint Diagram }}}}}

#### Sprint Planning

As demonstrated by the graph above the sprints have a clearly defined
start and end. Most pods in the web team use JIRA to keep track of
tickets and will store a backlog of all of the tasks they need to get
to. This backlog is used when planning out exactly what should be done
for the next two-week sprint. Tickets are 'pulled in' to a sprint based
on the priority given by the PO, engineers and testers will work
together to discuss what they think can realistically be accomplished.

#### Development Stage

Once a set of tickets have been agreed for the sprint there is then
two-weeks of continuous workflow where every day the pod will meet to
discuss progress. At this point the engineers will pick up tickets from
the sprint backlog, working towards completing the requirements
specified on the ticket.

#### Pull Request Review Stage

When a developer completes a piece of work he will open a pull request
(PR) which can then be reviewed by at least one other developer. It will
be checked to ensure the code has been written to a high standard and
that it looks suitable without introducing avoidable technical debt. If
the reviewer(s) deem it acceptable then the code will move on in the
process to the testing phase. If not, then the original developer will
usually discuss the feedback given and adapt the code as they see fit.
This cycle continues until the code is deemed acceptable.

#### Testing Stage

During this phase the tester(s) of the pod will prove that the code
works on their own machine in a range of scenarios. They will typically
test it across different browsers and environments to prove thoroughly
that it works as expected. This helps to cover areas that the engineer
wouldn't have tested and even use cases that they may not have known
about. If there are any problems at this stage it will be sent back to
the engineer to be investigated and addressed. If the fix involves code,
then the process jumps back up to the development stage and has to come
back through review. Eventually when the requirements have been met and
no issues are found during testing it will be deployed.

#### Deployment Stage

Due to the closeness of testing and deploying this stage will usually be
handled by the tester. There are two main steps of deployment, one of
which is to deploy to staging and another from staging to production.
The staging environment exists as a sandbox, hidden from customers but
providing a more realistic testing environment than a local machine.
This is another reason that deployments are commonly handled by testers,
because they can use the time in staging to give it one final test
before it goes live. As soon as a production deployment has been
finished the change will be visible to the customers.

#### Mid-Sprint Review

During this iterative deployment approach work will be deployed
frequently so some pods find a mid-sprint meeting beneficial. This
meeting is used to look back on the progress that has been made so far,
evaluate any blockers, issues and whether the sprint is still
achievable. In some cases, work will be removed from the sprint to align
priorities that need to be completed, or extra tickets could be pulled
in if the sprint is going well. The agile coach will play an important
balancing game during these meetings to ensure the sprint stays in
equilibrium.

{{{ Post-sprint DEMO to stakeholders }}}

#### Post-sprint Retrospective (retro)

At the end of the sprint there will be a retrospective session that will
look back at the sprint as a whole, evaluate what went well as a pod and
what didn't go so great. The agile coach will often prepare unique ways
to run this meeting, but the goal is ultimately the same; to get
everyone talking honestly and sharing their opinions. From the back of
these meetings the pod should make adjustments in the future sprints to
improve. I personally struggled with the retros in the Customer
Experience Pod, every two weeks we'd have the same discussions, and
nothing changed for months. They became dull and dreary and I had given
up on the process actually making a difference. I haven't since been in
a pod that has actually had retros, so I can't say I've seen a
first-hand contrast in another team.

What's it actually like?
------------------------

In many ways Holiday Extras does manage to live up to its ethos and
start-up vibe. Even without having worked anywhere else I can still
recognise the uniqueness of the workplace. The entire open plan office
has an air of friendliness where the atmosphere stays relaxed, and
everyone is approachable. This really helped me in my early days when I
was adjusting and settling in to the office. The ability to go to anyone
in the web team for help in such an easy and inviting environment really
sped up my initial learnings. I feel thankful to have had that
opportunity when I needed it most.

Even more than the casual discussions around desks that keep the
day-to-day entertaining there are plenty of fun events organised. As
early as my first week with HX we were outside playing tennis and eating
strawberries with cream to celebrate Wimbledon.

<http://take.ms/ESIEt>

These events have continued throughout my time here including recently
bush craft, human foosball and a rounders tournament. It's been really
refreshing to attend the events just to get out of the continuous work
mode and get to know colleagues better.

Besides the organised events there are often impromptu goings on and
treats hosted for us. For example, we were given mince pies around
Christmas, our own Easter eggs at Easter and frequent free ice cream
throughout the summer. It's nice to receive these little boosts
throughout the day and further shows the uniqueness of the HX workplace.

We also have the hosted 'shout outs' every Thursday afternoon where
directors or even the CEO himself will update us on the business'
progress, our success against the budget, any new starters, leavers and
more. Another key feature is the calling out cards which are essentially
nominations given out for notably displaying the HX values. I can
remember being called out as part of the Customer Experience pod and
appreciating the recognition and gratitude for my work. It definitely
goes a long way to making hard work feel worthwhile when it's noticed
and rewarded.

Another huge element of HX that makes it stand out as a unique culture
is the Project Lounge (PL) Fridays. These occur on a fortnightly basis
and offer an entire day just for personal development or working on a
project to help push the business forward. It's great to be given this
free reign and have the ability to make a difference through creative
ideas. I benefitted hugely from these during the start of my placement
since I could spend an entire day digging deep into HX's technology and
frameworks. I've continued to enjoy PL time throughout the year and have
found the time extremely beneficial to my own development.

In summary, I've found the environment at HX has really aided my overall
development throughout this year. My technical skills have been improved
because of how comfortably I can approach people and gain insight
easily. Whilst my personal skills have improved tenfold, especially
moulded by office chatter and special social events helping me network
with colleagues.

Timeline
========

![](media/image3.png){width="7.048611111111111in"
height="3.964583333333333in"}This section will give a quick overview of
where I've spent my time during my journey at HX. Providing context for
the next few sections of the report that will detail my experiences
during onboarding, time with different pods and other notable events.

Onboarding
==========

When jo­ining HX there is an initial three-month onboarding period in
which a basic set of objectives must be achieved to ensure you're fit
for the company. This period had a high focus on our individual learning
as Industrial Placement Students (IPs).

{{{ Talk about my introduction week, laptop setup, time spent shadowing
Jamie+Becky, laptop setup, repo setup.. shock of how many projects I'd
need etc }}}

Workshops were hosted for us every Tuesday and Thursday which provided
us with knowledge about Node, git, frameworks like React and specific
platforms at HX. Some of the earliest sessions were overly basic but
brimming with HX context. Although I can remember them ramping up in
difficulty, with a talk by Mark Fermor about containerisation with
Docker being far too complex. Looking back, my start at HX would have
been a lot slower had it not been for these classes at the beginning.

Weekly 1-2-1s
-------------

Throughout this period, I also had to meet with my manager on a weekly
basis for what HX calls a 1-2-1. At first this made me a little nervous,
coming from no work experience I'd never had a manager to report to
about my progress. However, after my first 1-2-1 I realised there wasn't
much to fear and that it was actually quite casual. They felt like more
of a catch-up with gentle guidance around benefitting more from my
onboarding time.

Looking back, I can recognise that these sessions helped me
considerably. Before joining HX I struggled to reflect and envision ways
I could improve myself as an individual. This is why I came into my year
with simplistic objectives (((Describe my pre-year objectives during my
intro and link back to section))) about gaining experience in the
industry. It was the realisations that I came to in my reflective 1-2-1
sessions that highlighted key areas where I could focus my efforts and
improve. I can remember discussing my communicative weaknesses early on
and being able to evidence improvements just weeks later. The reactive
nature of these meetings proved extremely useful and having them every
week enabled me to adapt quickly during this period. This set me leaps
and bounds ahead in comparison to when I first joined.

Pod Rotations
-------------

Following my first introductory week I spent three weeks rotating into
different pods, gaining insight into what they each did and how they
worked. This also offered a good opportunity to get to meet other
members of the team, building up a repertoire of familiar faces. As part
of this experience our manager had us present to himself and the other
IPs at the end of each rotation. This gave us an opportunity to share in
each other's learnings as well as practice our presentation skills.

### New Products 

For my first rotation I spent a week with the new products pod. They
focus on creating new ventures for the company outside of the
traditional core products. This involves a full flow from
conceptualisation, creation, market launch and maintenance during the
initial growth. Some of their more successful products include rental
car hire, resort transfers and FastTrack passes, even if those passes
were sold at cost price for the first 6 weeks.

During my time with new products I managed to get my hands stuck in and
helped work on some tickets whilst also being exposed to more of the
sprint process. Just within my first two days they had their end of
sprint demo to their stakeholders, followed the next day by the planning
of their upcoming sprint. At first it felt strange to be attending their
serious meetings, but they were very accommodating and didn't expect
much from me, it was more to give me the experience and see what they
were like. I appreciate the exposure that I gained from this when I look
back on it.

### API 

Having gotten to grips with the work I was given in the new products pod
and beginning to understand the sprint process I was excited coming into
my week with the API pod, especially seeing as it had the potential to
be more technical than I'd seen so far.

During the week that I spent with the API pod they were fairly far into
a large project called Thunderbird. This project aimed to merge together
our UK booking system with its German counterpart so that we had a
single central platform, rather than having a difficult to expand
system-per-country. The unified result of this project would make it
much easier to globalise HX's business.

To achieve this, we would spend time every day at 2pm comparing diffs
between responses from the live systems with the experimental unified
system. Over time this would highlight every single difference there is
until the responses are always the same. I enjoyed getting involved with
this work since it was a big get together as a team, all working to
investigate the differences and seeing what needed changing and where.
This helped me expand on my group communication at the stages where it
was becoming clearer as one of my weakest areas.

Aside from this I also managed to get my hands dirty and picked up some
quite technical work within the pod. They already had figured out the
diff process for the responses from both systems and asked me to expand
this for NOMREP files. I had no idea what the NOMREP files were at
first, but George Bates helped get me up to speed explaining that they
were essentially transactional logs in an ugly tab-separated format. By
the end of the week I had successfully implemented a diff process for
these files which produced readable output in the browser with colour
highlighting, shown below.

![](media/image4.png){width="2.5708661417322833in"
height="2.188976377952756in"}

I was really glad to have been able to get stuck into this challenging
ticket with the pod due to my concern about whether the placement would
be technical enough for me. It had me re-assured that there was still
plenty on offer for me at HX despite some pods having a large web focus.

### Customer Experience

{{{ Should I actually explain what CEX is here seeing as they're my next
permanent pod section??? (explain and link to the section where I go
deep) }}}

My final rotation was into the customer experience (CEX) pod which felt
like a bit of a strange choice in this process, seeing as they would be
my first permanent pod anyway. I would have preferred the opportunity to
be immersed into another pod's work to broaden my horizons further.
Despite this I still managed to enjoy the week getting to know my final
pod and gaining a head start into working with them.

I spent the majority of this rotation pairing up with Tom Price who as
an ex-IP was quick to offer me assistance, running me through CEX's
projects as a whole and pairing with me on my first ticket. This really
helped me kickstart my week with them and lead to me completing a few
tickets with a reasonable level of independence. This boosted my
confidence in my technical ability at this early stage, leaving me
feeling more comfortable to work on my own even so early on. I'm glad HX
offered the opportunity for this autonomy. {{{ Could quote the feedback
tom gave me on this? }}}

The one ticket that stands out to me was a re-design of the CARE login
page, this is used daily by the call centre (CC) staff and hadn't been
changed for a long time. Tom regretfully admitted to me that the
original was actually something he had made in a rush before. The reason
this ticket stands out is that it was done during one of CEX's CC sit-in
days, where we would work from desks within the CC, so they could
approach us to raise issues as one of the pod's "customers". This
allowed me to spend time on a few designs of a new login page and
actually go and collect opinions from the CC. Initially it was quite
intimidating to approach people in the CC but Han had offered to support
me and it ended up being fine. I feel that this ticket was extremely
beneficial to me as it showed me the importance of the design stage, as
well as communicating with the customers at the earliest opportunity. My
final product could have been a lot worse had I not sought out
![](media/image5.tiff){width="3.472205818022747in" height="2.0in"}their
opinions before the actual implementation.

{{{ Can't find an original gabble screenshot }}}

\[\[\[CEX-1418\]\]\]

### Finishing off

As the onboarding period drew to a close it was time to prepare for my
review with my manager, aiming to prove that I had achieved the
objectives set out for the three months. A lot of this was done based on
feedback collected through the 360 system, which is used to collect
opinions from up to ten colleagues. I luckily received a lot of good
feedback from the people I'd worked with closely and those who'd seen me
during rotations. On top of this, I discussed the huge improvements in
my communication over a short course of time, which Luke agreed with
also.

After successfully passing onboarding we were welcomed to the team in
the week's shoutout where we were each given a HX hoodie and bottle of
champagne. It felt nice to be invited into the team with this
announcement as a recognition of a good start.

Customer Experience
===================

Having already spent a week with CEX during my onboarding rotations my
actual joining of this pod didn't feel hugely ceremonious. Although I
was still glad to make a start on settling into my long-term pod, saying
goodbye to the learning intensive onboarding period.

Background
----------

The customer experience pod (CEX) are focussed around fixing
customer-raised issues and enhancing their interactions with us, as well
as supporting operations in the call centre to improve how well we can
serve customers. In a realistic world, the vagueness of what can improve
a customer's experience leaves some odd work filtering down to the pod.
The primary focus during my time in the pod was to encourage customers
to self-serve rather than relying on the call centre for support.

### People

The pod had a fairly typical structure and process according to the
agile process I've already described ( {{{ link }}} ), originally
consisting of:

-   Mark Cridland (Product Manager)

-   Han Cork (Agile Coach)

-   Becky Cox (50% Tester)

-   Jamie Matthews (Tester)

-   Mike Holloway (Remote Engineer - UK)

-   Adrian Kateliev (Remote Engineer -- Bulgaria)

-   Kiril Panchev (Remote Engineer -- Bulgaria)

-   Tom Price (Engineer -- UK)

The people within the pod ended up changing far more frequently than it
probably should have due to re-structures, resignations and maternity
leave. Therefore, I'm not going to detail every change to this and
instead highlight only ones that made a pivotal difference in my year.

Notable events
--------------

During my 7 months with the pod there are a few key events that shaped
my experience, highlighting my strengths and weaknesses throughout the
ups and downs.

### Void of Tom Price

After only one day of officially joining the pod it was announced Tom
Price would be moving. They needed his resources in a pop-up pod to fix
a data violation that google would punish us for in SEO rankings. This
shook some of the confidence I'd built as Tom was one of the people I'd
worked closest with thus far. I was a bit worried about now being the
only engineer within the pod that works from the office, especially
trying to fill in where Tom's vast knowledge was.

I knew I had one week left with Tom in the pod and had the easiest
access to him in the office, therefore I turned his departure in an
opportunity to cement myself within the pod. I spent the rest of the
week working with him and had arranged a full handover on the Friday,
where he ran me through all of the stuff he was in the middle of
including handing over PRs directly to me. I tried to gather as much
knowledge as possible to carry forth for the pod's benefit. This settled
my nerves a little and left me feeling comfortable as what I was calling
the "Budget Tom Price". I was further re-assured during my following
1-2-1 where Mark and Han had fed back to Luke the value they found in my
investment.

### Welcoming of Jordan Clague

Jordan joined the pod just before Christmas and it fell down to me to
spend time getting him up to speed. We spent all of the day together,
with about two hours dedicated to talking through what the pod does, who
is involved and what projects we have. Moving on to helping him setup
codebases and getting him through his first ticket.

Looking back, this actually provided a lot of value to me. It helped me
see how much I had improved with my communication even in a mentoring
scenario I hadn't really experienced before. I've also received good
feedback from Jordan about this experience:

> *"John was the pod member who walked me though my pod\'s previous (and
> current) work when joining the pod and sat with me as I worked on my
> first ticket and set up numerous systems. At the time, I wouldn\'t
> have assumed John was an IP due to how confident / assured John was."
> *
>
> ***- Jordan***

This feedback amplified the overall experience and proved that my focus
on improving my communication was paying off. I appreciated the
opportunity to gain experience as a mentor.

What I did
----------

During my time in the pod I managed to pick up quite varied work as was
the nature of CEX's tickets. I found this useful as a new starter since
it gave me a good breadth of knowledge about areas across the business.
Having said that, I also managed to find opportunities to cover some
areas more thoroughly through projects that I took the lead on.

The broader areas of my work in the pod involved picking up tickets on
Render, which was a front-end platform we were the owners of. This means
that we had some semblance of responsibility for maintenance, enforcing
best practices and playing a role in the bigger decisions surrounding
its future. We also consistently worked with HAPI, which is HX's own API
for handling bookings, product lookups, supplier info and other data
retrieval to support other platforms. There were also projects further
from the core that we worked on including gabble, hammertime and some of
our own purpose built microservices.

{{{ Contrast paragraph linking to projects section }}}

### Booking History

One of my earliest projects was the new booking history service, this
was handed over to me from Tom Price and ended up being my sole focus
for my first two to three months in the pod.

The booking history service aimed to form a new centralised source of
booking information. Before it's conception booking data was siloed in
to a few different data stores across platforms, making it hard to
retrieve a holistic set of data on bookings. The pre-existing method to
look up bookings involved talking directly to CHIPS, the legacy booking
platform at the centre of our operations. Besides limitations in the
expandability here as CHIPS is maintained externally, it's also an
unnecessary load added to an outdated platform that won't always handle
it gracefully.

####  {#section-1 .ListParagraph}

With this aim in mind the solution took the form of a microservice using
our in-house dockyard architecture, which consisted of tools that aimed
to make it simple for engineers to create, deploy and maintain smaller
individual codebases. This contrasts hugely with some of HX's core
projects, like HAPI, which were monolithic projects with little
separation of responsibilities. The booking history service would
actually become one of the earlier projects built on this architecture
offering. It was exciting to be building on top of brand new technology
to HX at the time.

When Tom handed over to me the service had actually already been started
by him, but he hadn't pushed too far into it. He talked me through it
during the handover I arranged which enabled me to pick up exactly where
it had been left.

The overall design of the service included listening to events from our
in-house purpose-built data pipeline and populate a MySQL database with
the information provided. The pipeline provided a way of sending and
receiving events, where we would be relying on the "server\_ecommerce"
event being sent when a booking is made. We would need to listen for
these events and extract data from them, which would be stored into the
database.

#### Challenges

Although the overview of this service seemed to be quite simple there
were still quite a few challenges that cropped up along the way. Some of
these stemmed from my lack of experience but equally there were issues
experience engineers struggled to explain.

Initially my biggest challenge was simply getting to grips with NodeJS,
the entire microservice implementation at HX and especially the
asynchronous nature of this application. All of these are things I
hadn't dealt with in great detail before and had to pick up for the
first time during this project. All things considered, I would say this
actually ended up going quite well. It only took me a few weeks to be
running with this project and have a good grasp about the main concepts
employed. The confidence gained here helped me to feel comfortable with
being at the forefront of a big project so early on at HX. I'm thankful
for the opportunity to have been trusted so early on.

##### Duplicate Events

There came a more serious challenge when we seemed to be receiving
duplicate events from the data pipeline. This was detrimental to the
service as it had the potential to pollute the data, creating
inconsistencies that would be unfavourable when trying to create the
single source of truth about bookings. So much so that it actually ended
up being a focus for an entire month. I had to spend a lot of time
investigating the exact cause of the duplication and struggled to come
up with anything. I can remember looping in more experienced engineers,
including those who created the data pipeline and the microservice
architecture and none of them had an answer for me either.

Eventually my suspicions lead to there being a deeper issue within
CHIPS, moreover surrounding the webhooks that CHIPS sends to our systems
when a booking is made. This would fall on the external Chauntry team to
be fixed, but unfortunately, they were completely occupied with the
ongoing thunderbird project. This meant that the problem wouldn't be
fixed at its core for a long while, we had to work our way around this.

My original proposed solution was to implement a cache for the service.
This involved caching every booking that we received, as well as
checking the cache before ever storing a booking. This *should* have
allowed us to eliminate duplicate entries from ever being allowed to
enter the database. I discussed this with various engineers around the
business before starting it and everyone agreed that it was a sensible
solution. However, once this had been implemented and tested it proved
to be only partially effective. This puzzled me for a few days, as well
as the engineers I spoke to about it. On paper and during local testing
this change was undeniably a suitable solution. However, it just didn't
behave correctly in production, we suspected this was to do with the
fact the service ran across multiple instances in production causing a
race condition. At this point I'd become frustrated with the project, I
constantly kicked myself for not being able to provide a perfect
solution.

Finally, I concluded that nothing right now could solve the duplicate
event issue on the ingested data. Therefore, I decided to fix the issue
by re-structuring the database. It would now accept multiple entries for
a single booking, but when requested we would **only** provide the most
recent information. This didn't feel very clean, but it was the only
true solution on the table in the timeframe, especially with the
Chauntry team being completely occupied.

##### Stakeholder Pressure

During the difficulty with the duplicated events there was also pressure
from above, our stakeholders were struggling to understand the value of
booking history due to the time it was taking. I took this upon myself
and spoke to all of the people I knew who were waiting for it to be
ready. I got them all to send me the reasoning behind what they wanted
and why, providing this to Mark and Han to help them convince the
stakeholders. I received feedback from both of them that they really
appreciated the initiative I showed, and it helped a lot with pursuing
the project to completion. This lifted my spirits and helped me get back
on track instead of being in a rut of frustration.

#### Thoughts and feelings

This project came very early in my placement at HX and provided me with
a good set of learning opportunities, especially surrounding the
microservice architecture at HX. I believe that it really helped me
build confidence early on and establish myself within the pod and the
wider web team.

I was quite lucky to start with microservices as they are self-contained
and don't come with years of legacy bundled into them, making the
initial understanding much easier. This sped up my early progress and
enabled me to showcase my abilities to the pod, building their
confidence in me owning this project. I don't think an entire
experienced pod would put this in my hands at this stage had I not been
able to prove my confidence.

At the same time, this project wasn't without it's difficulties.
Throughout all of the problems described I noticed that I picked myself
apart too much. I can remember frequent drives home during the duplicate
issues where I would kick myself for not solving it that day. This
frustration wasn't beneficial to anybody and would only put my mental
state in a rut. In future I should be more aware that this negativity
doesn't actually help, instead focusing on things in a different more
positive light. Especially considering this was a problem that
experienced engineers couldn't figure out and agreed with my proposals
on.

### Reviews

Towards the end of my time in CEX I got involved with a project to make
our reviews more transparent and clear. Mainly, our stakeholders wanted
us to base our ratings and displayed reviews off of the last two years
of data. Previously reviews were historical from the date of the
product's conception, which meant that if it had been changed recently
it would be hard for that to be reflected in reviews.

Towards the end of my time in the pod I got involved with investigating
issues surrounding reviews on the website. Our stakeholders wanted us to
only show reviews that were within the past two years, rather than since
the products conception. Sounds simple enough, right?

Unfortunately, this ended up being a complicated issue riddled with
challenges caused by legacy tech. I spent a lot of time with Ricardo,
who had experience with the original system, digging deeper into where
reviews come from and how they're stored. The information was collected
via surveys sent to customers after their trips, it included a basic
rating of the product, rating of HX and any comments they might have.
All of which was fine as a collection source, however the way the
database that stored this had been designed was not fit for our purpose.

Rather than containing a persistent store of all reviews the database
stored a calculated result which was deleted and replaced daily by a
cron job. The fact that this was an overwriting operation and
continuously erased previous data there was no easy way for us to just
query for two years of data. I ended up working closely with Adrian on
this and we tried to create a second table containing summaries for two
years of data. This began to work sort of as expected, but it also
exposed some deeper underlying issues with the way reviews were
originally created.

Due to these complications I ended up having to leave the pod without
finishing the project. This was disappointing, it's not easy to walk
away from a project and not have closure on it. I did manage to reduce
the frustration of this by arranging a handover to Jordan who'd joined
the pod two months prior. I have since seen him carry the project to
completion, which laid the project to rest once and for all in my mind.

Overall, I feel that this project actually went reasonably well. There
were issues with the legacy tech and the archaic database design but, it
eventually was solved with the help of my investigation and partial
solution. I think one of the key results was also how it helped
establish me across the wider team rather than just my pod. This was
shown by the fact that I became the "go to guy" for a while on this
subject, especially when Ricardo, who I originally sought help from,
started sending people to me. It was also a final proof for my
communication-based objectives at the time, since there were a lot of
new faces involved seeking updates, explanations and discussions
from/with me.

{{{ Thoughts and feelings of the entire pod experience }}}

-   Loved the people, great team, if I was here forever I would want to
    always stay with them

-   Spent too long there but....

-   Work wasn't always exciting and it could be annoying tweaks and
    fixes

Tech Foundations (Dev stream)
=============================

My second pod move felt long overdue by the time I eventually switched
to Tech Foundations, I'd become stale where I was and was extremely
excited for the change. Especially being invited closer to the back-end
where I had always originally envisioned myself.

During the week that I joined the pod was actually splitting up into
three streams. The original Tech Foundation pod grew large and had
multiple separate focuses, therefore it was split into Dev Foundations,
UI Foundations and Data Foundations. The specific stream I've been
focused in is Dev Foundations.

Background
----------

The Dev foundations stream focuses on helping other engineers ship code
quickly and with the best processes possible. This is achieved by
providing easy access to infrastructure and purpose-built toolsets,
especially in the form of the microservice architecture.

The microservice architecture and all of the tools surrounding it are
actually the biggest single focus of the pod. Throughout my time in the
pod almost everything we've been working on has revolved around
maintaining, improving and expanding our offering to the team. This
included our own in-house self-built CI service, dockyard-deploy
scripts, dockyard-tools like dockyard-rpc and many others.

### People

This pod had an atypical structure compared to the rest of HX. We didn't
have an individual Product Manager and Agile Coach, instead we had Steve
who acted as a role somewhere in between. Our entire structure was:

-   Steve Coppin-Smith ("Pod Lead")

-   Oliver Rumbelow (Engineer)

-   Mark Fermor (Site Reliability Engineer)

-   Khusro Jaleel (Site Reliability Engineer)

This list is quite a bit shorter than what I laid out as a 'normal' pod
at HX earlier in this report. Not only did we have Steve as an overall
pod lead, we lacked a tester and two members of the team had a unique
SRE role.

The SRE role has a deep focus on the actual infrastructure behind what
we offer to the rest of the team. They are in charge of technical setup,
maintenance and management of our staging and production environments,
the processes of deployment to them and some of the steps in between. In
all truth, they had a wide-ranging set of responsibilities due to how
important the infrastructure was as part of our microservice offering.

The Engineers in the pod (Myself and Oli) were focused on the areas
which required larger portions of code written. This mainly covered
tools and interfaces between the engineers and the infrastructure we
were providing.

I feel that I actually landed in a unique position within the pod. I was
really the only engineer that had recently worked on the other side of
the coin, consuming all of these tools rather than creating. As well as
the fact I maintained a connection with engineers from the rest of the
business. This meant that I was surrounded by people full of feedback on
the tools we were providing, and I had a good grasp on features that
they wanted offered. I found it extremely useful to be able to bring
these viewpoints to the pod, applying it to the work I undertook.

### Process

The process within dev foundations was a complete contrast to what I had
experienced in CEX and how the majority of the web team operates. We
didn't use jira to keep track of tickets, our only big meetings were
bi-weekly demos and there was less dictation from above. Every engineer
in the pod functioned with a lot of autonomy, taking control of the
entire lifecycle of tasks from identification, design, implementation,
deployment and maintenance. As long as what we were doing provided value
against our current quarterly OKRs we could decide entirely solo what to
work on.

Having come from a pod where stakeholders chose exactly what they wanted
done each sprint this was a completely new experience. It initially took
me some getting used to, it's hard to start self-identifying what needs
to be improved without an initial grasp on some of this tech. Luckily,
Steve seemed aware of this and during the early days he had Oli help me
find things to do. Over time I settled in to the approach and actually
got quite good at self-organising within the pod, keeping all possible
tasks on a todo list in slack.

What I did
----------

The tooling we offered to engineers was comprised of various different
services, scripts and codebases, meaning that I managed to gain
experience in a wide spanning set of projects. Especially encouraged by
the self-driven nature of the work where I could find and improve any
aspect of the process.

Some of the codebases that I worked with most frequently were the
ci-service, infrastructure-service and access-service. Although outside
of larger projects I've managed to delve into many areas, including
scripts written to automate annoying tasks. One example of this was a
script I wrote to audit exactly which version of the node-toolbox was
being used across all 100+ microservices. This helped us know who was
far out of date and would come into issues as we needed to release
critical updates.

Outside of the smaller improvements and fixes made across all codebases
I also had some key areas of focus. The two most notable examples are
the access-service and dependency graphing projects that I worked on,
both of which are detailed in my projects section.

Notable events
--------------

I felt my time within dev foundations was actually a lot less eventful
than CEX, in terms of people or process changes. It contrasted hugely
from CEX where It felt that every new sprint came with a new
resignation, pod member leaving or completely new faces joining. There
was only one event that actually stands out in dev foundations.

### Steve's sudden resignation

Steve's resignation came in extremely short notice and was a shock to
all but his closest friends. He spoke to us privately on the day of the
announcement to explain some of his reasoning before almost disappearing
within the same day, taking his last bits of annual leave before he
went. I didn't see this coming even though I'd personally observed some
of the areas that frustrated him, including the bastardised agile
process that was too far from the original agile manifesto for his
liking. He'd done an amazing job of applying a more barebones process to
our pod, but the business wouldn't let this approach spread further.

I was concerned initially about the pod without Steve but he truly had
made us highly autonomous in a way that would allow us to continue
without him. So far, we've clearly managed to prove that we're capable
of this to our stakeholders as we still operate without a pod lead to
this day.

This entire experience was surprising since it came out of the blue, but
I feel the fact I've managed to continue delivering and supporting my
teammates is a testament to how the year has shaped me. It shows the
level of confidence, self-organisation and drive I've developed to be
able to continue thriving in an autonomous workflow independently. Steve
even provided me feedback upon his departure that reassured me about the
value I brought to the pod. This left me in a confident position to
carry on without him.

Thoughts and feelings
---------------------

Overall, I feel that the dev foundations pod has given me exactly the
technical challenge I was looking for. It's been an incredible
experience to work alongside such talented engineers and gain insight
into the deeper world of infrastructure. I've benefitted hugely in terms
of knowledge but also the confidence it's given me, being able to hold
my own even surrounded by some of HXs most experienced technical
engineers. I have faith in myself, my work and the rest of my career in
this area thanks to the opportunity.

I've felt especially lucky to work with Mark and gain insight into his
deeply technical world. He's willingly taken me under his wings to show
me about containerisation, kubernetes and cloud architecture. All of
which play a hugely important part in our systems and many of those in
use in the modern world outside of HX. I'm happy to have had the
opportunity to learn so much about modern infrastructure that's becoming
used globally.

Microservice Re-homing
----------------------

Ever since the earliest design of microservices they've been imagined as
belonging to a specific team, we call these owners. This ownership is
significant for who maintains and takes responsibility for each service,
whilst also correlating to significance in the architecture running
them. This originally meant that from point of conception this owner was
set in stone, due to the declarative infrastructure supporting them
which wasn't easy to move around.

However, with the businesses shift towards shorter-term mission-based
pods which could come and go dynamically, there would be issues with the
long-term ownership model. With this now becoming more necessary I took
charge of investigating the possibility of re-homing services.

I spent time plotting out all different dependent areas which stored and
relied on information about who the owner was. I narrowed it down to
this list:

-   Grafana Dashboard

-   Github Teams

-   Package.json

-   Sumologic collectors

-   Database instances

I then explored the APIs for each of these areas and managed to build a
proof-of-concept script for almost all of them, showing that re-homing
would be a definitely possibility. The only thing that seemed more
difficult was re-allocating the databases, which I've detailed further
in the challenges section.

Having shown the pod my initial investigation into this they were happy
with my evidence that re-homing would be possible, although it was never
going to be easy. I stepped forward and started working on it right
away, turning my proof-of-concept into a fully-fledged process. I
appreciated that the pod had enough trust to leave this in my hands even
though I'd only been with the pod for a few months.

Eventually, I had the entire script built and working as an RPC endpoint
in the access service. I spent time testing this before taking it to our
demo and proudly showing the stakeholders what I'd achieved. It felt
great to be able to tackle real problems for the pod and have a large
impact.

I was also tasked with making a workplace post about the project. I had
this edited by Steve and he had nothing but praise for the writing, and
the post seemed well received by the web team. This was a nice
confirmation of my written communication and helped prove that I had
improved in these areas. It also boosted my recognition across the web
team as now everyone comes to me for all things access-service and
service re-homing. It's nice to receive appreciation for work that I've
achieved and knowing it's having the desired impact.

### Challenges

Throughout the project the complications of database re-homing loomed
over my head. In the initial design of microservices lead to there being
a database instance per pod, which hosted a database per-service within
it. The diagram below explains this structure a little further:

This shows that all databases are grouped into an overall database
instance that is created per-team. Meaning that to move a database's
ownership it has to be transferred from one instance to another, which
is complicated and leaves practically unavoidable downtime during the
move.

I spent some time drafting ideas on a way to write a completely
down-time free moving mechanism, but it was extremely complex. I
arranged one or two meetings with the pod to discuss this around a
whiteboard. In these sessions we eventually agreed that it was too much
investment at this point. Instead settling with leaving the databases
for how they are. There's no technical limitation that means the
databases **have** to be moved, but with a multi-tenancy instance setup
there can be negative effects. For example, if one of the services on
the instance has an extremely busy database and the load is too much all
co-tenant databases could be affected. This is why they were originally
grouped by team, it would be the team's own fault if their other
databases were affected. We'd now be leaving it up to luck which
databases are co-tenants on each instance. One day we might come back to
this if it becomes an issue but it's functional as is for now.

### Thoughts and Feelings

This project stands out as one of the more impactful things I got to do
at HX. It completely changed the previous approach to microservice
ownership, shifting the singular responsibility into dynamic
responsibility across the web team, leaving pods open to pick up and own
services fluidly.

Due to the fact this was one of my earlier pieces of work in dev
foundations it also established my place as a vital contributor.
Building this trust and respect within the pod has proved useful ever
since, being able to confidently speak my mind and know the pod will
fully consider what I say. It's fair to say this could have been much
harder without opportunities like this, especially being surrounded by
engineers with vastly more experience than me in an extremely technical
pod.

I also managed to demonstrate my problem solving and decision-making
skills throughout the investigative stages of the project. Especially
when I took the initiative to host meetings to discuss the database
problem.

Overall, I feel this project was valuable to the business and even more
worthwhile for my own development. I got to independently experience a
complex issue all the way from investigation, design and final
implementation. Carrying a project like this through from start to
finish on my own so early in my career reassures my confidence and trust
in myself.

Dependency Graphing
-------------------

Seeing as we have over 100 microservices deployed into our live
environments it can be hard to keep track of, especially for the
majority of services that communicate with each other via RPC. There had
been quite a few expedites recently in which confusing
cross-communication had obscured where the issue was coming from, and as
such we needed to provide something to help engineers understand what's
actually going on.

To do this I took up a challenge of mapping out all communications that
are occurring via RPC. Luckily, all services which use RPC do so through
the node-toolbox, which we created, meaning I could be certain that the
metrics would be stored for all of these requests. This made my life
easier as the data was already prepared in a suitable format, I just had
to work on pulling it out of Prometheus and displaying it for users.

I spent a while investigating which graphing tools we could use
including CLI tools, online APIs and actual modules. Steve was pushing
for me to learn and use D3, but the learning curve seemed too steep for
it to actually be worthwhile. I sought alternatives and found a
dependency wheel tool that could generate a D3 dependency wheel for me.
The result of this can be seen below:

![](media/image6.tiff){width="5.447222222222222in"
height="4.554166666666666in"}

> (Each service could be hovered to obscure the other lines for clarity)

At this point Steve chatted to me and he had envisioned more capability
from the graph, rather than just showing exactly which services are
communicating. He continued to push for a D3 graph, but I refuted that
it was necessary, even questioning whether this was becoming more of a
vanity project not worth the time investment. However, I was convinced
that we could gain value from showing more information especially as a
live graphic, I just didn't believe D3 was necessary.

I sought alternatives and eventually settled on Vis.js after testing it
to build a simple node graph. This proof-of-concept was proof enough
that the Vis.js library would be suitable, so I moved on to preparing
the data.

The data was in a static format that wasn't necessarily built for live
display which meant I had to be a little creative. I settled for two
different Prometheus queries, one to pull back *ALL* of the RPC events
and another to fetch only the ones that occurred in the last 10 minutes.
I used the exhaustive list of events to build up the structure of the
graph as a holistic view of our systems. I then used the 10-minute data
as a layer on top of the graph to visualise recent traffic, including
colouring lines based on traffic and success rate, and showing a
breakdown of which RPC functions were being called. As shown below:

![](media/image7.tiff){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.6180555555555554in"}

This shows how the final version of the graph looked with each node
being a service, each line representing communication between services,
and colours representing success rates and traffic volume.

I was further asked to do a presentation of this for the backend-guild
and also post about it on workplace. Both of which were well received as
demonstrated by some feedback below:

> *"Good presentation, showcasing the solution and explaining the
> problems it solved. Clear and detailed demonstration of the features
> of the system."* - Pedro Romano

### Thoughts and feelings

-   Infrastructure RPC dashboards

-   Recent expedites, with so many services (100+) it's hard to always
    know where issues **stem** from

-   Evaluation of options, CLI implementation of graphviz, online
    website api, eventually gave up to d3 demands, looked at vis.js --
    still looks easier than d3 and just as good. Began to prep data
    sources, initial version, feedback form pod, added the function
    breakdown, presented, feedback on legend -- added legend and posted
    to workplace

-   Good feedback from stakeholders during demo -- Si wood got excited
    and was talking about having it take a screenshot every week to see
    our inf grow (needs seedy thing)

    -   Workplace post is a good piece to mention, lots of love

    -   ALSO the presentation I hosted
