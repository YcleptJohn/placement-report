Introduction to my Year in Industry
===================================

During the university selection process, the year in industry programmes
really stood out to me, making it easy to say that I was excited for
this year. It became one of the most pivotal factors in my decision to
turn down King's College London and come to Kent. The placement scheme
sounded so much more fleshed out and enriching here. Having this passion
before I had even made it to the year in the industry really fuelled my
anticipation for the year.

Why Holiday Extras?
-------------------

It's fair to say that before Holiday Extras came to present at the
university I had never heard of them, so what was so enticing? Whilst
it's hard to honestly be excited about selling airport parking; the
role, benefits, and emphasis they placed on their placement program
really stood out. They also told us they only source students from Kent
and that a lot of them had kept graduate positions, meaning that I'd
already be surrounded by people of similar experiences.

Their entire presentation conveyed an image of an extremely relaxed and
fun workplace with all the vibes of a start-up. They boasted about all
the awards they'd received acknowledging them as one of the best places
to work in the UK. They also had current placement students give their
stories and experiences of their placement, all of which told tales of
many learnings and great opportunities at HX.

Whilst all of this was promising I was initially reluctant to settle
into a web-based role. I wasn't completely against the idea but work
closer to the back-end had always interested me more. Due to this I
initially passed up the opportunity and only came back to apply when
applications re-opened. By that time, I had realised that the work
environment, benefits, and opportunities were too good to ignore.

Journey to Holiday Extras
-------------------------

Having come into the placement process with no previous work experience
I was at a complete fresh start without even a CV prepared. Luckily, by
the time it came to my application at HX I'd already sorted out my CV,
sent applications and even had an interview.

### Initial Interviews

The interview was with a company called SquaredUp who are a small
start-up close to my home in London. Whilst it was useful to gain
experience the process also knocked my confidence a little, they asked
some fart-assy questions that put me on the spot more than expected.
However, it also showed me that interviews are a two-way process, from
those questions alone I knew that company was too 'hippy' to be a good
fit for me.

### Application + Interview with HX

After putting in an application to HX I received an invitation to an
assessment day. This day consisted of a group task, presentation, and
individual interview. On the day I remember feeling nervous before
arriving, but the relaxed environment helped me to settle in quickly
once there.

We started with the group task which required us to plan out the
handling of travel disruption caused by snow. We had to plan an email to
customers as well design a system for the call centre to use as a means
of reporting contact with customers. At first this was a little daunting
to be working on with three unknown peers, but I quickly became
distracted in trying to make the best impression possible; engaging with
the group, conversing about ideas, and turning them into a full
solution. When it came time to present our work the calm atmosphere
helped me present confidently and I went to lunch pleased with my
performance so far.

This quiet confidence in my performance so far really helped me going
into the individual interview. In a complete contrast to my experience
with SquaredUp this seemed to go a lot smoother. I didn't feel that many
questions really put me on the spot too much and I was able to be open
about my initial reluctance to a web role. They had many re-assurances
for me that there was enough modern technology in use to keep things
interesting. This made me feel that they really understood where I was
coming from and saw that my focus was on learning as much as possible. I
appreciated what they had to offer in that regard.

I eventually left the day feeling pleased with the impression I'd given
as well as being sure that this type of environment was for me. I began
to realise how much this role would resonate with me despite my initial
feelings.

### Offer from HX

After about a month I received a phone call telling me that HX would
like to offer me the position. I accepted the role then and there
because I'd spent all of the time since the assessment day feeling sure
that it was the right fit for me.

Holiday Extras: a brief overview
--------------------------------

Holiday Extras started its life as the Apple Booking Company (ABC) when
it was founded by Gerry Pack in 1983. It came to fruition when Gerry
noticed a gap in the Airport Hotels market, they had previously been
targeted to business travellers and never towards leisure travellers.
Initially this was achieved through a simple booking platform in
partnership with travel consultants who latched on to the idea; the new
market area provided lucrative and convenient business.

Throughout 35 years of growth and a rebranding as Holiday Extras, the
company's offerings have expanded hugely, and they now specialise in a
vast array of travel products. This includes airport parking, lounges,
insurance, car hire, resort transfers and more. Now having around 800
employees situated across offices in Kent, Germany and Bulgaria it's
fair to say the company has grown with its success.

During those early years the company strived as a platform for travel
agents to make bookings for their own clients, but April 2000 saw the
launch of the HX website. Along with it came the ability for direct
customers to make bookings. This was a large step at the time as most
travel companies were only targeting one market or the other, not both.
Nowadays over 90% of bookings come via the website with less and less
reliance on the call centre for business.

My Job Role
-----------

When joining my official job title was as an 'Engineer' which kept
things open to interpretation. It was difficult to predict exactly what
that might encompass initially. However, it soon became clear why it was
left open with each team serving different purposes through different
platforms. It was clear there would be many opportunities for me to
learn across all of these different areas, platforms and codebases. I
understood why 'Web Developer' didn't truly fit the bill of this job
despite that being the main throughput.

During my time with HX I managed to gain experience across a variety of
systems and I ended up truly appreciating the fluidity of my role. Not
only did I have the opportunity to work on the front-end of the site,
but my manager actually planned my second team to be a challenging
back-end focused role. This gave me a taste of both worlds and really
helped to push my learning to a higher level, I'm thankful that my own
development was such a focal point for the company.

Working for Holiday Extras
==========================

This section will detail the structure and process of HX as well as how
I feel about my time spent interacting with it as a whole.

Firstly, to pre-face, despite the fact HX has \~800 employees there are
\~150 of us in the actual web team where I've spent all of my time.
Therefore, the majority of what I speak about will be the structure and
process of this web team as a subset of the entire team. This also
affects how much I enjoyed my work at HX, the web team is held on a
pedestal and treated the best out of the business. We're given fun
events, encouraged to attend subsidised conferences and provided the
flexibility do these things. Whilst some roles in the CC only have small
windows of time to actually enjoy what makes us such a "fun start-up".
So yes, *I* am the 1%.

Web Team Structure
------------------

The web team is one of the biggest areas of focus within HX since there
is a direct link to customers and a huge potential to drive growth and
profit. It would be fair to say the work that's done within the web team
has some of the biggest influence on HX's success.

The entire team is split up into smaller sub-teams known as pods, which
were recently renamed to 'teams' but this hasn't caught on yet. Pods
were originally focused around a single area of the business, taking on
all work that relates to that area. For example, the euro pod would pick
up work that would improve the experience for our European customers.
This approach allows each pod to work independently in a self-contained
manner, with cross-pod communication still available for larger
multi-pod projects.

There's also the concept of 'pop-up pods' which would be created to
achieve shorter term goals that either, didn't fit into a single pod or
needed multi-disciplined engineers to achieve. A good example of this is
the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) pod, which started when we
had \<40 days to fix something which Google would detract our SEO
rankings for.

Within the last few months of my placement the company began making a
shift towards 'mission-based' pods. The intention of this was that pods
would spawn dynamically around missions that the company wanted to
achieve. This makes the pods much more reactive and allows fluidity with
the assignment of engineers to missions that they suit best.

I personally have remained within a pod that isn't truly mission based
so I've not experienced it first-hand but it sounds like a sensible
approach.

Pod Structure
-------------

As much as the web team is built of pods each pod contains a concoction
of roles that make the pod successful. The exact structure varies
per-pod, but most pods contain a few engineers, a software tester, an
agile coach and a product owner.

**Engineers**

The engineers within a pod are one of the main workhorses. They spend
the majority of their time writing code to actually implement new
features or fix issues. They're also involved within the planning of
work by helping use their experience to estimate the difficulty or time
investment of certain pieces of work.

**Software Testers**

The testers within a pod are responsible for testing the work
implemented by the engineers, they will ensure it works as expected in a
variety of environments and scenarios. This is especially important
within HX's complex systems as there are often use cases that engineers
might not have considered. Testers also typically offer a huge wealth of
knowledge about the business and the complexity of all systems combined.

**Agile Coach (AC)**

The agile coach within a pod typically manages the workflow of the pod
on a day-to-day basis. They will ensure that the agile process
([detailed in 2.3](#Agile Process)) is followed and that everyone can
achieve what they've set out without issue.

The agile coach within a pod manages the workflow of a pod on a
day-to-day basis. Ensuring that everyone in the team can work
efficiently and effectively together without being affected by blockers
on their work.

**Product Owner (PO)**

The product owners are responsible for managing relations with
stakeholders, communicating and setting goals for the pod. This ensures
the work being done suits the business and stakeholders' needs.

Each of these roles play a vital part of each pod at HX and when
combined they form a strong core structure for the pod to thrive off of.

Agile Process
-------------

Every pod within the web team uses an agile approach which aims to
deliver work quickly in an incremental pattern. This has become common
within technology where the flaws of older methodologies, like the
waterfall model, have been highlighted by the adaptive and reactive
nature of modern technology.

### Sprint Structure

At HX this process manifests as bi-monthly sprints which aim to be a
self-enclosed two-week section of work.

{{{{{ Sprint Diagram }}}}}

#### Sprint Planning

As demonstrated by the graph above the sprints have a clearly defined
start and end. Most pods in the web team use JIRA to keep track of
tickets and will store a backlog of all of the tasks they need to get
to. This backlog is used when planning out exactly what should be done
for the next two-week sprint. Tickets are 'pulled in' to a sprint based
on the priority given by the PO, engineers and testers will work
together to discuss what they think can realistically be accomplished.

#### Development Stage

Once a set of tickets have been agreed for the sprint there is then
two-weeks of continuous workflow where every day the pod will meet to
discuss progress. At this point the engineers will pick up tickets from
the sprint backlog, working towards completing the requirements
specified on the ticket.

#### Pull Request Review Stage

When a developer completes a piece of work he will open a pull request
(PR) which can then be reviewed by at least one other developer. It will
be checked to ensure the code has been written to a high standard and
that it looks suitable without introducing avoidable technical debt. If
the reviewer(s) deem it acceptable then the code will move on in the
process to the testing phase. If not, then the original developer will
usually discuss the feedback given and adapt the code as they see fit.
This cycle continues until the code is deemed acceptable.

#### Testing Stage

During this phase the tester(s) of the pod will prove that the code
works on their own machine in a range of scenarios. They will typically
test it across different browsers and environments to prove thoroughly
that it works as expected. This helps to cover areas that the engineer
wouldn't have tested and even use cases that they may not have known
about. If there are any problems at this stage it will be sent back to
the engineer to be investigated and addressed. If the fix involves code,
then the process jumps back up to the development stage and has to come
back through review. Eventually when the requirements have been met and
no issues are found during testing it will be deployed.

#### Deployment Stage

Due to the closeness of testing and deploying this stage will usually be
handled by the tester. There are two main steps of deployment, one of
which is to deploy to staging and another from staging to production.
The staging environment exists as a sandbox, hidden from customers but
providing a more realistic testing environment than a local machine.
This is another reason that deployments are commonly handled by testers,
because they can use the time in staging to give it one final test
before it goes live. As soon as a production deployment has been
finished the change will be visible to the customers.

#### Mid-Sprint Review

During this iterative deployment approach work will be deployed
frequently so some pods find a mid-sprint meeting beneficial. This
meeting is used to look back on the progress that has been made so far,
evaluate any blockers, issues and whether the sprint is still
achievable. In some cases, work will be removed from the sprint to align
priorities that need to be completed, or extra tickets could be pulled
in if the sprint is going well. The agile coach will play an important
balancing game during these meetings to ensure the sprint stays in
equilibrium.

#### Post-sprint Retrospective (retro)

At the end of the sprint there will be a retrospective session that will
look back at the sprint as a whole, evaluate what went well as a pod and
what didn't go so great. The agile coach will often prepare unique ways
to run this meeting, but the goal is ultimately the same; to get
everyone talking honestly and sharing their opinions. From the back of
these meetings the pod should make adjustments in the future sprints to
improve. I personally struggled with the retros in the Customer
Experience Pod, every two weeks we'd have the same discussions, and
nothing changed for months. They became dull and dreary and I had given
up on the process actually making a difference. I haven't since been in
a pod that has actually had retros, so I can't say I've seen a
first-hand contrast in another team.

What's it actually like?
------------------------

-   -   Is it as relaxed as I initially expected?  

    -   The feeling of the office

    -   The actual workflow on a day to day

    -   Shoutouts/PLs and other things you don't really get elsewhere
