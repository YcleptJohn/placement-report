Introduction to my Year in Industry
===================================

During the university selection process, the year in industry programmes
really stood out to me, making it easy to say that I was excited for
this year. It became one of the most pivotal factors in my decision to
turn down King's College London and come to Kent. The placement scheme
sounded so much more fleshed out and enriching here. Having this passion
before I had even made it to the year in the industry really fuelled my
anticipation for the year.

Why Holiday Extras?
-------------------

It's fair to say that before Holiday Extras came to present at the
university I had never heard of them, so what was so enticing? Whilst
it's hard to honestly be excited about selling airport parking; the
role, benefits, and emphasis they placed on their placement program
really stood out. They also told us they only source students from Kent
and that a lot of them had kept graduate positions, meaning that I'd
already be surrounded by people of similar experiences.

Their entire presentation conveyed an image of an extremely relaxed and
fun workplace with all the vibes of a start-up. They boasted about all
the awards they'd received acknowledging them as one of the best places
to work in the UK. They also had current placement students give their
stories and experiences of their placement, all of which told tales of
many learnings and great opportunities at HX.

Whilst all of this was promising I was initially reluctant to settle
into a web-based role. I wasn't completely against the idea but work
closer to the back-end had always interested me more. Due to this I
initially passed up the opportunity and only came back to apply when
applications re-opened. By that time, I had realised that the work
environment, benefits, and opportunities were too good to ignore.

Journey to Holiday Extras
-------------------------

Having come into the placement process with no previous work experience
I was at a complete fresh start without even a CV prepared. Luckily, by
the time it came to my application at HX I'd already sorted out my CV,
sent applications and even had an interview.

### Initial Interviews

The interview was with a company called SquaredUp who are a small
start-up close to my home in London. Whilst it was useful to gain
experience the process also knocked my confidence a little, they asked
some fart-assy questions that put me on the spot more than expected.
However, it also showed me that interviews are a two-way process, from
those questions alone I knew that company was too 'hippy' to be a good
fit for me.

### Application + Interview with HX

After putting in an application to HX I received an invitation to an
assessment day. This day consisted of a group task, presentation, and
individual interview. On the day I remember feeling nervous before
arriving, but the relaxed environment helped me to settle in quickly
once there.

We started with the group task which required us to plan out the
handling of travel disruption caused by snow. We had to plan an email to
customers as well design a system for the call centre to use as a means
of reporting contact with customers. At first this was a little daunting
to be working on with three unknown peers, but I quickly became
distracted in trying to make the best impression possible; engaging with
the group, conversing about ideas, and turning them into a full
solution. When it came time to present our work the calm atmosphere
helped me present confidently and I went to lunch pleased with my
performance so far.

This quiet confidence in my performance so far really helped me going
into the individual interview. In a complete contrast to my experience
with SquaredUp this seemed to go a lot smoother. I didn't feel that many
questions really put me on the spot too much and I was able to be open
about my initial reluctance to a web role. They had many re-assurances
for me that there was enough modern technology in use to keep things
interesting. This made me feel that they really understood where I was
coming from and saw that my focus was on learning as much as possible. I
appreciated what they had to offer in that regard.

I eventually left the day feeling pleased with the impression I'd given
as well as being sure that this type of environment was for me. I began
to realise how much this role would resonate with me despite my initial
feelings.

### Offer from HX

After about a month I received a phone call telling me that HX would
like to offer me the position. I accepted the role then and there
because I'd spent all of the time since the assessment day feeling sure
that it was the right fit for me.

Holiday Extras: a brief overview
--------------------------------

Holiday Extras started its life as the Apple Booking Company (ABC) when
it was founded by Gerry Pack in 1983. It came to fruition when Gerry
noticed a gap in the Airport Hotels market, they had previously been
targeted to business travellers and never towards leisure travellers.
Initially this was achieved through a simple booking platform in
partnership with travel consultants who latched on to the idea; the new
market area provided lucrative and convenient business.

Throughout 35 years of growth and a rebranding as Holiday Extras, the
company's offerings have expanded hugely, and they now specialise in a
vast array of travel products. This includes airport parking, lounges,
insurance, car hire, resort transfers and more. Now having around 800
employees situated across offices in Kent, Germany and Bulgaria it's
fair to say the company has grown with its success.

During those early years the company strived as a platform for travel
agents to make bookings for their own clients, but April 2000 saw the
launch of the HX website. Along with it came the ability for direct
customers to make bookings. This was a large step at the time as most
travel companies were only targeting one market or the other, not both.
Nowadays over 90% of bookings come via the website with less and less
reliance on the call centre for business.

gained more about communication etc)

My Job Role
-----------

When joining my official job title was as an 'Engineer' which kept
things open to interpretation. It was difficult to predict exactly what
that might encompass initially. However, it soon became clear why it was
left open with each team serving different purposes through different
platforms. It was clear there would be many opportunities for me to
learn across all of these different areas, platforms and codebases. I
understood why 'Web Developer' didn't truly fit the bill of this job
despite that being the main throughput.

During my time with HX I managed to gain experience across a variety of
systems and I ended up truly appreciating the fluidity of my role. Not
only did I have the opportunity to work on the front-end of the site,
but my manager actually planned my second team to be a challenging
back-end focused role. This gave me a taste of both worlds and really
helped to push my learning to a higher level, I'm thankful that my own
development was such a focal point for the company.

Working for Holiday Extras
==========================

This section will detail the structure and process of HX as well as how
I feel about my time spent interacting with it as a whole.

Firstly, to pre-face, despite the fact HX has \~800 employees there are
\~150 of us in the actual web team where I've spent all of my time.
Therefore, the majority of what I speak about will be the structure and
process of this web team as a subset of the entire team. This also
affects how much I enjoyed my work at HX, the web team is held on a
pedestal and treated the best out of the business. We're given fun
events, encouraged to attend subsidised conferences and provided the
flexibility do these things. Whilst some roles in the CC only have small
windows of time to actually enjoy what makes us such a "fun start-up".
So yes, *I* am the 1%.

Web Team Structure
------------------

The web team is one of the biggest areas of focus within HX since there
is a direct link to customers and a huge potential to drive growth and
profit. It would be fair to say the work that's done within the web team
has some of the biggest influence on HX's success.

The entire team is split up into smaller sub-teams known as pods, which
were recently renamed to 'teams' but this hasn't caught on yet. Pods
were originally focused around a single area of the business, taking on
all work that relates to that area. For example, the euro pod would pick
up work that would improve the experience for our European customers.
This approach allows each pod to work independently in a self-contained
manner, with cross-pod communication still available for larger
multi-pod projects.

There's also the concept of 'pop-up pods' which would be created to
achieve shorter term goals that either, didn't fit into a single pod or
needed multi-disciplined engineers to achieve. A good example of this is
the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) pod, which started when we
had \<40 days to fix something which Google would detract our SEO
rankings for.

Within the last few months of my placement the company began making a
shift towards 'mission-based' pods. The intention of this was that pods
would spawn dynamically around missions that the company wanted to
achieve. This makes the pods much more reactive and allows fluidity with
the assignment of engineers to missions that they suit best.

I personally have remained within a pod that isn't truly mission based
so I've not experienced it first-hand but it sounds like a sensible
approach.

Pod Structure
-------------

As much as the web team is built of pods each pod contains a concoction
of roles that make the pod successful. The exact structure varies
per-pod, but most pods contain a few engineers, a software tester, an
agile coach and a product owner.

**Engineers**

The engineers within a pod are one of the main workhorses. They spend
the majority of their time writing code to actually implement new
features or fix issues. They're also involved within the planning of
work by helping use their experience to estimate the difficulty or time
investment of certain pieces of work.

**Software Testers**

The testers within a pod are responsible for testing the work
implemented by the engineers, they will ensure it works as expected in a
variety of environments and scenarios. This is especially important
within HX's complex systems as there are often use cases that engineers
might not have considered. Testers also typically offer a huge wealth of
knowledge about the business and the complexity of all systems combined.

**Agile Coach (AC)**

The agile coach within a pod typically manages the workflow of the pod
on a day-to-day basis. They will ensure that the agile process
([detailed in 2.3](#Agile Process)) is followed and that everyone can
achieve what they've set out without issue.

The agile coach within a pod manages the workflow of a pod on a
day-to-day basis. Ensuring that everyone in the team can work
efficiently and effectively together without being affected by blockers
on their work.

**Product Owner (PO)**

The product owners are responsible for managing relations with
stakeholders, communicating and setting goals for the pod. This ensures
the work being done suits the business and stakeholders' needs.

Each of these roles play a vital part of each pod at HX and when
combined they form a strong core structure for the pod to thrive off of.

Agile Process
-------------

Every pod within the web team uses an agile approach which aims to
deliver work quickly in an incremental pattern. This has become common
within technology where the flaws of older methodologies, like the
waterfall model, have been highlighted by the adaptive and reactive
nature of modern technology.

### Sprint Structure

At HX this process manifests as bi-monthly sprints which aim to be a
self-enclosed two-week section of work.

{{{{{ Sprint Diagram }}}}}

#### Sprint Planning

As demonstrated by the graph above the sprints have a clearly defined
start and end. Most pods in the web team use JIRA to keep track of
tickets and will store a backlog of all of the tasks they need to get
to. This backlog is used when planning out exactly what should be done
for the next two-week sprint. Tickets are 'pulled in' to a sprint based
on the priority given by the PO, engineers and testers will work
together to discuss what they think can realistically be accomplished.

#### Development Stage

Once a set of tickets have been agreed for the sprint there is then
two-weeks of continuous workflow where every day the pod will meet to
discuss progress. At this point the engineers will pick up tickets from
the sprint backlog, working towards completing the requirements
specified on the ticket.

#### Pull Request Review Stage

When a developer completes a piece of work he will open a pull request
(PR) which can then be reviewed by at least one other developer. It will
be checked to ensure the code has been written to a high standard and
that it looks suitable without introducing avoidable technical debt. If
the reviewer(s) deem it acceptable then the code will move on in the
process to the testing phase. If not, then the original developer will
usually discuss the feedback given and adapt the code as they see fit.
This cycle continues until the code is deemed acceptable.

#### Testing Stage

During this phase the tester(s) of the pod will prove that the code
works on their own machine in a range of scenarios. They will typically
test it across different browsers and environments to prove thoroughly
that it works as expected. This helps to cover areas that the engineer
wouldn't have tested and even use cases that they may not have known
about. If there are any problems at this stage it will be sent back to
the engineer to be investigated and addressed. If the fix involves code,
then the process jumps back up to the development stage and has to come
back through review. Eventually when the requirements have been met and
no issues are found during testing it will be deployed.

#### Deployment Stage

Due to the closeness of testing and deploying this stage will usually be
handled by the tester. There are two main steps of deployment, one of
which is to deploy to staging and another from staging to production.
The staging environment exists as a sandbox, hidden from customers but
providing a more realistic testing environment than a local machine.
This is another reason that deployments are commonly handled by testers,
because they can use the time in staging to give it one final test
before it goes live. As soon as a production deployment has been
finished the change will be visible to the customers.

#### Mid-Sprint Review

During this iterative deployment approach work will be deployed
frequently so some pods find a mid-sprint meeting beneficial. This
meeting is used to look back on the progress that has been made so far,
evaluate any blockers, issues and whether the sprint is still
achievable. In some cases, work will be removed from the sprint to align
priorities that need to be completed, or extra tickets could be pulled
in if the sprint is going well. The agile coach will play an important
balancing game during these meetings to ensure the sprint stays in
equilibrium.

{{{ Post-sprint DEMO to stakeholders }}}

#### Post-sprint Retrospective (retro)

At the end of the sprint there will be a retrospective session that will
look back at the sprint as a whole, evaluate what went well as a pod and
what didn't go so great. The agile coach will often prepare unique ways
to run this meeting, but the goal is ultimately the same; to get
everyone talking honestly and sharing their opinions. From the back of
these meetings the pod should make adjustments in the future sprints to
improve. I personally struggled with the retros in the Customer
Experience Pod, every two weeks we'd have the same discussions, and
nothing changed for months. They became dull and dreary and I had given
up on the process actually making a difference. I haven't since been in
a pod that has actually had retros, so I can't say I've seen a
first-hand contrast in another team.

What's it actually like?
------------------------

In many ways Holiday Extras does manage to live up to its ethos and
start-up vibe. Even without having worked anywhere else I can still
recognise the uniqueness of the workplace. The entire open plan office
has an air of friendliness where the atmosphere stays relaxed, and
everyone is approachable. This really helped me in my early days when I
was adjusting and settling in to the office. The ability to go to anyone
in the web team for help in such an easy and inviting environment really
sped up my initial learnings. I feel thankful to have had that
opportunity when I needed it most.

Even more than the casual discussions around desks that keep the
day-to-day entertaining there are plenty of fun events organised. As
early as my first week with HX we were outside playing tennis and eating
strawberries with cream to celebrate Wimbledon.

<http://take.ms/ESIEt>

These events have continued throughout my time here including recently
bush craft, human foosball and a rounders tournament. It's been really
refreshing to attend the events just to get out of the continuous work
mode and get to know colleagues better.

Besides the organised events there are often impromptu goings on and
treats hosted for us. For example, we were given mince pies around
Christmas, our own Easter eggs at Easter and frequent free ice cream
throughout the summer. It's nice to receive these little boosts
throughout the day and further shows the uniqueness of the HX workplace.

We also have the hosted 'shout outs' every Thursday afternoon where
directors or even the CEO himself will update us on the business'
progress, our success against the budget, any new starters, leavers and
more. Another key feature is the calling out cards which are essentially
nominations given out for notably displaying the HX values. I can
remember being called out as part of the Customer Experience pod and
appreciating the recognition and gratitude for my work. It definitely
goes a long way to making hard work feel worthwhile when it's noticed
and rewarded.

Another huge element of HX that makes it stand out as a unique culture
is the Project Lounge (PL) Fridays. These occur on a fortnightly basis
and offer an entire day just for personal development or working on a
project to help push the business forward. It's great to be given this
free reign and have the ability to make a difference through creative
ideas. I benefitted hugely from these during the start of my placement
since I could spend an entire day digging deep into HX's technology and
frameworks. I've continued to enjoy PL time throughout the year and have
found the time extremely beneficial to my own development.

In summary, I've found the environment at HX has really aided my overall
development throughout this year. My technical skills have been improved
because of how comfortably I can approach people and gain insight
easily. Whilst my personal skills have improved tenfold, especially
moulded by office chatter and special social events helping me network
with colleagues.

Timeline
========

![](media/image3.png){width="7.048611111111111in"
height="3.964583333333333in"}This section will give a quick overview of
where I've spent my time during my journey at HX. Providing context for
the next few sections of the report that will detail my experiences
during onboarding, time with different pods and other notable events.

Onboarding
==========

When jo­ining HX there is an initial three-month onboarding period in
which a basic set of objectives must be achieved to ensure you're fit
for the company. This period had a high focus on our individual learning
as Industrial Placement Students (IPs).

{{{ Talk about my introduction week, laptop setup, time spent shadowing
Jamie+Becky, laptop setup, repo setup.. shock of how many projects I'd
need etc }}}

Workshops were hosted for us every Tuesday and Thursday which provided
us with knowledge about Node, git, frameworks like React and specific
platforms at HX. Some of the earliest sessions were overly basic but
brimming with HX context. Although I can remember them ramping up in
difficulty, with a talk by Mark Fermor about containerisation with
Docker being far too complex. Looking back, my start at HX would have
been a lot slower had it not been for these classes at the beginning.

Weekly 1-2-1s
-------------

Throughout this period, I also had to meet with my manager on a weekly
basis for what HX calls a 1-2-1. At first this made me a little nervous,
coming from no work experience I'd never had a manager to report to
about my progress. However, after my first 1-2-1 I realised there wasn't
much to fear and that it was actually quite casual. They felt like more
of a catch-up with gentle guidance around benefitting more from my
onboarding time.

Looking back, I can recognise that these sessions helped me
considerably. Before joining HX I struggled to reflect and envision ways
I could improve myself as an individual. This is why I came into my year
with simplistic objectives (((Describe my pre-year objectives during my
intro and link back to section))) about gaining experience in the
industry. It was the realisations that I came to in my reflective 1-2-1
sessions that highlighted key areas where I could focus my efforts and
improve. I can remember discussing my communicative weaknesses early on
and being able to evidence improvements just weeks later. The reactive
nature of these meetings proved extremely useful and having them every
week enabled me to adapt quickly during this period. This set me leaps
and bounds ahead in comparison to when I first joined.

Pod Rotations
-------------

Following my first introductory week I spent three weeks rotating into
different pods, gaining insight into what they each did and how they
worked. This also offered a good opportunity to get to meet other
members of the team, building up a repertoire of familiar faces. As part
of this experience our manager had us present to himself and the other
IPs at the end of each rotation. This gave us an opportunity to share in
each other's learnings as well as practice our presentation skills.

### New Products 

For my first rotation I spent a week with the new products pod. They
focus on creating new ventures for the company outside of the
traditional core products. This involves a full flow from
conceptualisation, creation, market launch and maintenance during the
initial growth. Some of their more successful products include rental
car hire, resort transfers and FastTrack passes, even if those passes
were sold at cost price for the first 6 weeks.

During my time with new products I managed to get my hands stuck in and
helped work on some tickets whilst also being exposed to more of the
sprint process. Just within my first two days they had their end of
sprint demo to their stakeholders, followed the next day by the planning
of their upcoming sprint. At first it felt strange to be attending their
serious meetings, but they were very accommodating and didn't expect
much from me, it was more to give me the experience and see what they
were like. I appreciate the exposure that I gained from this when I look
back on it.

### API 

Having gotten to grips with the work I was given in the new products pod
and beginning to understand the sprint process I was excited coming into
my week with the API pod, especially seeing as it had the potential to
be more technical than I'd seen so far.

During the week that I spent with the API pod they were fairly far into
a large project called Thunderbird. This project aimed to merge together
our UK booking system with its German counterpart so that we had a
single central platform, rather than having a difficult to expand
system-per-country. The unified result of this project would make it
much easier to globalise HX's business.

To achieve this, we would spend time every day at 2pm comparing diffs
between responses from the live systems with the experimental unified
system. Over time this would highlight every single difference there is
until the responses are always the same. I enjoyed getting involved with
this work since it was a big get together as a team, all working to
investigate the differences and seeing what needed changing and where.
This helped me expand on my group communication at the stages where it
was becoming clearer as one of my weakest areas.

Aside from this I also managed to get my hands dirty and picked up some
quite technical work within the pod. They already had figured out the
diff process for the responses from both systems and asked me to expand
this for NOMREP files. I had no idea what the NOMREP files were at
first, but George Bates helped get me up to speed explaining that they
were essentially transactional logs in an ugly tab-separated format. By
the end of the week I had successfully implemented a diff process for
these files which produced readable output in the browser with colour
highlighting, shown below.

![](media/image4.png){width="2.5708661417322833in"
height="2.188976377952756in"}

I was really glad to have been able to get stuck into this challenging
ticket with the pod due to my concern about whether the placement would
be technical enough for me. It had me re-assured that there was still
plenty on offer for me at HX despite some pods having a large web focus.

### Customer Experience

{{{ Should I actually explain what CEX is here seeing as they're my next
permanent pod section??? (explain and link to the section where I go
deep) }}}

My final rotation was into the customer experience (CEX) pod which felt
like a bit of a strange choice in this process, seeing as they would be
my first permanent pod anyway. I would have preferred the opportunity to
be immersed into another pod's work to broaden my horizons further.
Despite this I still managed to enjoy the week getting to know my final
pod and gaining a head start into working with them.

I spent the majority of this rotation pairing up with Tom Price who as
an ex-IP was quick to offer me assistance, running me through CEX's
projects as a whole and pairing with me on my first ticket. This really
helped me kickstart my week with them and lead to me completing a few
tickets with a reasonable level of independence. This boosted my
confidence in my technical ability at this early stage, leaving me
feeling more comfortable to work on my own even so early on. I'm glad HX
offered the opportunity for this autonomy. {{{ Could quote the feedback
tom gave me on this? }}}

The one ticket that stands out to me was a re-design of the CARE login
page, this is used daily by the call centre (CC) staff and hadn't been
changed for a long time. Tom regretfully admitted to me that the
original was actually something he had made in a rush before. The reason
this ticket stands out is that it was done during one of CEX's CC sit-in
days, where we would work from desks within the CC, so they could
approach us to raise issues as one of the pod's "customers". This
allowed me to spend time on a few designs of a new login page and
actually go and collect opinions from the CC. Initially it was quite
intimidating to approach people in the CC but Han had offered to support
me and it ended up being fine. I feel that this ticket was extremely
beneficial to me as it showed me the importance of the design stage, as
well as communicating with the customers at the earliest opportunity. My
final product could have been a lot worse had I not sought out
![](media/image5.tiff){width="3.472205818022747in" height="2.0in"}their
opinions before the actual implementation.

{{{ Can't find an original gabble screenshot }}}

\[\[\[CEX-1418\]\]\]

### Finishing off

As the onboarding period drew to a close it was time to prepare for my
review with my manager, aiming to prove that I had achieved the
objectives set out for the three months. A lot of this was done based on
feedback collected through the 360 system, which is used to collect
opinions from up to ten colleagues. I luckily received a lot of good
feedback from the people I'd worked with closely and those who'd seen me
during rotations. On top of this, I discussed the huge improvements in
my communication over a short course of time, which Luke agreed with
also.

After successfully passing onboarding we were welcomed to the team in
the week's shoutout where we were each given a HX hoodie and bottle of
champagne. It felt nice to be invited into the team with this
announcement as a recognition of a good start.

Customer Experience
===================

Having already spent a week with CEX during my onboarding rotations my
actual joining of this pod didn't feel hugely ceremonious. Although I
was still glad to make a start on settling into my long-term pod, saying
goodbye to the learning intensive onboarding period.

Background
----------

The customer experience pod (CEX) are focussed around fixing
customer-raised issues and enhancing their interactions with us, as well
as supporting operations in the call centre to improve how well we can
serve customers. In a realistic world, the vagueness of what can improve
a customer's experience leaves some odd work filtering down to the pod.
The primary focus during my time in the pod was to encourage customers
to self-serve rather than relying on the call centre for support.

### People

The pod had a fairly typical structure and process according to the
agile process I've already described ( {{{ link }}} ), originally
consisting of:

-   Mark Cridland (Product Manager)

-   Han Cork (Agile Coach)

-   Becky Cox (50% Tester)

-   Jamie Matthews (Tester)

-   Mike Holloway (Remote Engineer - UK)

-   Adrian Kateliev (Remote Engineer -- Bulgaria)

-   Kiril Panchev (Remote Engineer -- Bulgaria)

-   Tom Price (Engineer -- UK)

The people within the pod ended up changing far more frequently than it
probably should have due to re-structures, resignations and maternity
leave. Therefore, I'm not going to detail every change to this and
instead highlight only ones that made a pivotal difference in my year.

Notable events? Challenges? Idk ...name
---------------------------------------

### Void of Tom Price

Speaking of the fluidity of persons within the pod, after only one day
of officially joining the pod it was announced Tom Price would be
moving. They needed his resources in a pop-up pod to fix a data
violation that google would punish us for in SEO rankings. This shook
some of the confidence I'd built as Tom was one of the people I'd worked
closest with thus far. I was a bit worried about now being the only
engineer within the pod that works from the office, especially trying to
fill in where Tom's vast knowledge was.

I knew I had one week left with Tom in the pod and had the easiest
access to him in the office, therefore I turned his departure in an
opportunity to cement myself within the pod. I spent the rest of the
week working with him and had arranged a full handover on the Friday,
where he ran me through all of the stuff he was in the middle of
including handing over PRs directly to me. I tried to gather as much
knowledge as possible to carry forth for the pod's benefit. This settled
my nerves a little and left me feeling comfortable as what I was calling
the "Budget Tom Price". I was further re-assured during my following
1-2-1 where Mark and Han had fed back to Luke the value they found in my
investment.

What I did
----------

During my time in the pod I managed to pick up quite varied work as was
the nature of CEX's tickets. I found this useful as a new starter since
it gave me a good breadth of knowledge about areas across the business.
Having said that, I also managed to find opportunities to cover some
areas more thoroughly through projects that I took the lead on.

The broader areas of my work in the pod involved picking up tickets on
Render, which was a front-end platform we were the owners of. This means
that we had some semblance of responsibility for maintenance, enforcing
best practices and playing a role in the bigger decisions surrounding
its future. We also consistently worked with HAPI, which is HX's own API
for handling bookings, product lookups, supplier info and other data
retrieval to support other platforms. There were also projects further
from the core that we worked on including gabble, hammertime and some of
our own purpose built microservices.

### Booking History

One of my earliest projects was the new booking history service, this
was handed over to me from Tom Price and ended up being my sole focus
for my first two to three months in the pod.

The booking history service aimed to form a new centralised source of
booking information. Before it's conception booking data was siloed in
to a few different data stores across platforms, making it hard to
retrieve a holistic set of data on bookings. The pre-existing method to
look up bookings involved talking directly to CHIPS, the legacy booking
platform at the centre of our operations. Besides limitations in the
expandability here as CHIPS is maintained externally, it's also an
unnecessary load added to an outdated platform that won't always handle
it gracefully.

####  {#section-1 .ListParagraph}

With this aim in mind the solution took the form of a microservice using
our in-house dockyard architecture, which consisted of tools that aimed
to make it simple for engineers to create, deploy and maintain smaller
individual codebases. This contrasts hugely with some of HX's core
projects, like HAPI, which were monolithic projects with little
separation of responsibilities. The booking history service would
actually become one of the earlier projects built on this architecture
offering. It was exciting to be building on top of brand new technology
to HX at the time.

When Tom handed over to me the service had actually already been started
by him, but he hadn't pushed too far into it. He talked me through it
during the handover I arranged which enabled me to pick up exactly where
it had been left.

The overall design of the service included listening to events from our
in-house purpose-built data pipeline and populate a MySQL database with
the information provided. The pipeline provided a way of sending and
receiving events, where we would be relying on the "server\_ecommerce"
event being sent when a booking is made. We would need to listen for
these events and extract data from them, which would be stored into the
database.

#### Challenges

Although the overview of this service seemed to be quite simple there
were still quite a few challenges that cropped up along the way. Some of
these stemmed from my lack of experience but equally there were issues
experience engineers struggled to explain.

Initially my biggest challenge was simply getting to grips with NodeJS,
the entire microservice implementation at HX and especially the
asynchronous nature of this application. All of these are things I
hadn't dealt with in great detail before and had to pick up for the
first time during this project. All things considered, I would say this
actually ended up going quite well. It only took me a few weeks to be
running with this project and have a good grasp about the main concepts
employed. The confidence gained here helped me to feel comfortable with
being at the forefront of a big project so early on at HX. I'm thankful
for the opportunity to have been trusted so early on.

##### Duplicate Events

There came a more serious challenge when we seemed to be receiving
duplicate events from the data pipeline. This was detrimental to the
service as it had the potential to pollute the data, creating
inconsistencies that would be unfavourable when trying to create the
single source of truth about bookings. So much so that it actually ended
up being a focus for an entire month. I had to spend a lot of time
investigating the exact cause of the duplication and struggled to come
up with anything. I can remember looping in more experienced engineers,
including those who created the data pipeline and the microservice
architecture and none of them had an answer for me either.

Eventually my suspicions lead to there being a deeper issue within
CHIPS, moreover surrounding the webhooks that CHIPS sends to our systems
when a booking is made. This would fall on the external Chauntry team to
be fixed, but unfortunately, they were completely occupied with the
ongoing thunderbird project. This meant that the problem wouldn't be
fixed at its core for a long while, we had to work our way around this.

My original proposed solution was to implement a cache for the service.
This involved caching every booking that we received, as well as
checking the cache before ever storing a booking. This *should* have
allowed us to eliminate duplicate entries from ever being allowed to
enter the database. I discussed this with various engineers around the
business before starting it and everyone agreed that it was a sensible
solution. However, once this had been implemented and tested it proved
to be only partially effective. This puzzled me for a few days, as well
as the engineers I spoke to about it. On paper and during local testing
this change was undeniably a suitable solution. However, it just didn't
behave correctly in production, we suspected this was to do with the
fact the service ran across multiple instances in production causing a
race condition. At this point I'd become frustrated with the project, I
constantly kicked myself for not being able to provide a perfect
solution.

Finally, I concluded that nothing right now could solve the duplicate
event issue on the ingested data. Therefore, I decided to fix the issue
by re-structuring the database. It would now accept multiple entries for
a single booking, but when requested we would **only** provide the most
recent information. This didn't feel very clean, but it was the only
true solution on the table in the timeframe, especially with the
Chauntry team being completely occupied.

##### Stakeholder Pressure

During the difficulty with the duplicated events there was also pressure
from above, our stakeholders were struggling to understand the value of
booking history due to the time it was taking. I took this upon myself
and spoke to all of the people I knew who were waiting for it to be
ready. I got them all to send me the reasoning behind what they wanted
and why, providing this to Mark and Han to help them convince the
stakeholders. I received feedback from both of them that they really
appreciated the initiative I showed, and it helped a lot with pursuing
the project to completion. This lifted my spirits and helped me get back
on track instead of being in a rut of frustration.

Structure

-   Intro

    -   Why.. siloed chips bookings into a single source that was easy
        to access and wasn't a third party piece of shit that's hard to
        query in a distributed fashion.. already hanging on by a
        lifeline

    -   Take-over from Tom, barely started

    -   How it felt to be given quite a critical service to build from
        the ground up

        -   Trustedness

-   Explain detailed progress of the project

    -   DIFFICULTIES

        -   Primary key being a timestamp + ref, store rows for
            different events

        -   DUPLICATE EVENTS

    -   Dockyard introduction, microservices etc

    -   Figuring it out with some support from Mike Holloway when needed

        -   Can mention how I found the remote calls?

    -   Studying ecommerce events

    -   Trying to ensure that the database design I'd been left with was
        suitable for storing the necessary information

        -   Difficult to plan as it was hard to envision early the exact
            consumers of this service

        -   Stuck with the original big json blob storage as breaking it
            into columns would have been huge and would end up making a
            mess, especially if the schema ever changes in future etc
            etc

        -   The blob was robust and expandable easily

    -   Figuring out the best nodeJS approach to build code full of
        asynchronous code

        -   Hadn't worked too much with such an async focussed language
            etc

        -   Good learning experience

        -   Ended up going with a promise chain since that seemed
            cleaner than being 6 callbacks deep

        -   If async await existed back then it would have been so much
            easier but it didn't so tough

    -   Essentially built a data pipeline, listening to the
        server\_ecommerce events and deconstructing that, transforming
        it and storing it into the database.

    -   Exposing endpoints that would allow the data to be retrieved
        (handled mostly by Adrian and sam tbh)

    -   When Sam joined the pod and I showed him all of the booking
        history stuff he was surprised by how far I'd got with it and
        said he couldn't have done it himself

        -   Due to the fact I needed wider HX experience rather than a 3
            month focus on microservices

        -   Not always the newest technologies that need to be
            experience

        -   It's important to see the old issues to completely
            understand why we built the new architecture

        -   

### Reviews ?? Maybe not a full 'project' section seeing as it wasn't concluded, just good for the ricardo bit

### T2T -\> P2P?

{{{ Maybe do a journey through the pod? Timeline? }}}

Mention:

-   What they do, mission, process

-   Who? Han Cork etc -- initial pod

-   Tom Price's disappearance, handover of work on the Friday -- his
    email PRs

    -   Pressure of being the only dev in the office

    -   Han's support and messages to check up and see it wasn't
        worrying me

-   People stuff (probably don't mention it all)

    -   Sam Smart joining

        -   Taught him a lot, good 360 feedback about the grasp I have
            on microservices

        -   "I couldn't have done any of this microservice stuff without
            you" when helping on the booking history service

    -   Tom Vance joining as a part time base camp

    -   Han Cork going on pregnancy leave

    -   Kiril resigining

    -   Adrian moving to booking pod

    -   Jordan Clague joining

        -   His shadowing of me

        -   360 feedback!!!

    -   Mark Cridland moves to wales thing

    -   Phil Murphy joins, ends up resigning

    -   Jamie Matthews to new products

    -   Myself, Mike and Becky become the only people still around from
        when I joined the pod

-   Pod becoming dysfunctional over the sprint process, Jamie's stubborn
    attitude

-   The general work, almost all work can be justified as CEX, bit of a
    bottom of the filter, "the CC is our customer too" justification
    bullshit

-   Building up confidence and establishing myself within the pod

    -   The booking history case thing? Might be better here as an
        establishing move but I don't want to take it away from the
        projects section

-   The point when Sam spoke to Luke about us moving pods and Luke
    essentially said that right now I'm too vital to CEX that I can't
    leave

    -   Annoying that I was being restricted like that as an IP

    -   Also, a compliment that I was so pivotal at that moment

-   PROJECTES

    -   Booking history

    -   Reviews service

        -   When Ricardo started pointing people to me

        -   Frustrating and annoying underlying problems
