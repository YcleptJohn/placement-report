Introduction to my Year in Industry
===================================

During the university selection process, the year in industry programmes
really stood out to me, making it easy to say that I was excited for
this year. It became one of the most pivotal factors in my decision to
turn down King's College London and come to Kent. The placement scheme
sounded so much more fleshed out and enriching here. Having this passion
before I had even made it to the year in the industry really fuelled my
anticipation for the year.

Why Holiday Extras?
-------------------

It's fair to say that before Holiday Extras came to present at the
university I had never heard of them, so what was so enticing? Whilst
it's hard to honestly be excited about selling airport parking; the
role, benefits, and emphasis they placed on their placement program
really stood out. They also told us they only source students from Kent
and that a lot of them had kept graduate positions, meaning that I'd
already be surrounded by people of similar experiences.

Their entire presentation conveyed an image of an extremely relaxed and
fun workplace with all the vibes of a start-up. They boasted about all
the awards they'd received acknowledging them as one of the best places
to work in the UK. They also had current placement students give their
stories and experiences of their placement, all of which told tales of
many learnings and great opportunities at HX.

Whilst all of this was promising I was initially reluctant to settle
into a web-based role. I wasn't completely against the idea but work
closer to the back-end had always interested me more. Due to this I
initially passed up the opportunity and only came back to apply when
applications re-opened. By that time, I had realised that the work
environment, benefits, and learning opportunities were too good to
ignore.

Journey to Holiday Extras
-------------------------

Having come into the placement process with no previous work experience
I was at a complete fresh start without even a CV prepared. Luckily, by
the time it came to my application at HX I'd already sorted out my CV,
sent applications and even had an interview.

### Initial Interviews

The interview was with a company called SquaredUp who are a small
start-up close to my home in London. Whilst it was useful to gain
experience the process also knocked my confidence, they asked some
unusual theoretical questions that put me on the spot more than
expected. However, it showed me that interviews are a two-way process,
from those questions alone I knew that company was too 'hip' to be a
good fit for me.

### Application + Interview with HX

After putting in an application to HX I received an invitation to an
assessment day. This day consisted of a group task, presentation, and
individual interview. On the day I remember feeling nervous before
arriving, but the relaxed environment helped me to settle in quickly
once there.

We started with the group task which required us to plan out the
handling of travel disruption caused by snow. We had to plan an email to
customers as well design a system for the call centre to use as a means
of reporting contact with customers. At first this was a little daunting
to be working on with three unknown peers, but I quickly became
distracted in trying to make the best impression possible; engaging with
the group, conversing about ideas, and turning them into a full
solution. When it came time to present our work the calm atmosphere
helped me present confidently and I went to lunch pleased with my
performance.

This quiet confidence in my performance so far really helped me going
into the individual interview. In a complete contrast to my experience
with SquaredUp this went really smoothly. The questions didn't put me on
the spot as much and I was able to be open about my initial reluctance
to a web role. They had re-assurances for me that there was enough
modern technology in use to keep things interesting. This made me feel
that they really understood where I was coming from and saw that my
focus was on learning as much as possible. I appreciated what they had
to offer in that regard.

I eventually left the day feeling pleased with the impression I'd given
as well as being sure that this type of environment was for me. I began
to realise how much this role would resonate with me despite my initial
feelings.

### Offer from HX

After about a month I received a phone call telling me that HX would
like to offer me the position. I accepted the role then and there
because I'd spent all of the time since the assessment day feeling sure
that it was the right fit for me.

Holiday Extras: a brief overview
--------------------------------

Holiday Extras started out as the Apple Booking Company (ABC) when it
was founded by Gerry Pack in 1983. It came to fruition when Gerry
noticed a gap in the Airport Hotels market. They had previously been
targeted to business travellers and never towards leisure travellers,
which Gerry sought to change. Initially this was achieved through a
simple booking platform in partnership with travel consultants who
latched on to the idea; the new market area provided lucrative and
convenient business.

Throughout 35 years of growth and a rebranding as Holiday Extras, the
company's offerings have expanded hugely, now specialising in a vast
array of travel products. This includes airport parking, lounges,
insurance, car hire, resort transfers and more. All of which is
supported by over 800 employees situated across offices in Kent, Germany
and Bulgaria.

During those early years the company strived as a platform for travel
agents to make bookings for their own clients, but April 2000 saw the
launch of the HX website. Along with it came the ability for direct
customers to make bookings. This was a huge step at the time as most
travel companies were only targeting one market or the other, never
both. Nowadays over 90% of bookings come via the website with less and
less reliance on the call centre for business.

My Job Role
-----------

When joining my official job title was 'Engineer' which kept things open
to interpretation. It was initially difficult to predict exactly what
that might encompass. However, it soon became clear why it was left open
with each team serving different purposes through different platforms.
It was obvious there would be plenty of opportunities for me to learn
across all of these different areas, systems and codebases.

During my time with HX I managed to gain experience across a variety of
systems and I ended up truly appreciating the fluidity of my role. Not
only did I have the opportunity to work on the front-end of the site,
but my manager planned my second team to be a challenging back-end
focused role. This gave me a taste of both worlds and really helped to
push my learning to a higher level, I'm thankful that my own development
was such a focal point for the company.

Working for Holiday Extras
==========================

This section will detail the structure and process of HX as well as how
I feel about my time spent interacting with it as a whole.

Firstly, to pre-face, despite the fact HX has \~800 employees there are
\~120 of us in the web team where I've spent all of my time. Therefore,
the majority of what I speak about will be the structure and process of
this web team as a subset of the entire team.

Web Team Structure
------------------

The web team is one of the biggest areas of focus within HX since there
is a direct link to customers and a huge potential to drive growth and
profit. It would be fair to say the work of the web team has some of the
biggest influence on HX's success.

The entire team is split up into smaller sub-teams known as pods. Pods
were originally focused around a single area of the business, taking on
all work that relates to that area. For example, the euro pod would pick
up work that would improve the experience for our European customers.
This approach allows each pod to work independently in a self-contained
manner, with cross-pod communication still available for larger
projects.

There's also the concept of 'pop-up pods' which were created to achieve
short term goals, which either didn't fit into a single pod or needed
multi-discipline engineers to achieve. An example of this is the PII pod
which started when we had \~40 days to fix a data protection flaw that
Google would punish us for.

Within the last few months of my placement the company began making a
shift towards 'mission-based' pods. The intention of this was that pods
would spawn dynamically around missions that the company wanted to
achieve. This makes the pods much more reactive and allows fluidity with
the assignment of engineers to missions that they suit best.

Pod Structure
-------------

As much as the web team is built of pods each pod contains a concoction
of roles that make the pod successful. The exact structure varies
per-pod, but most pods contain a few engineers, a software tester, an
agile coach and a product owner.

**Engineers**

The engineers within a pod are one of the main workhorses. They spend
the majority of their time writing code to actually implement new
features or fix issues. They're also involved within the planning of
work by helping use their experience to estimate the difficulty or time
investment of certain pieces of work.

**Software Testers**

The testers within a pod are responsible for testing the work
implemented by the engineers, they will ensure it works as expected in a
variety of environments and scenarios. Their wealth of business
knowledge and understanding of our complex systems is extremely useful,
they will often test systems in situations engineers hadn't considered.

**Agile Coach (AC)**

The agile coach within a pod typically manages the workflow of the pod
on a day-to-day basis. They will ensure that the agile process (detailed
in 2.3) is followed and that everyone can achieve what they've set out
without issue.

**Product Owner (PO)**

The product owners are responsible for managing relations with
stakeholders, communicating and setting goals for the pod. This ensures
the work being done suits the business and stakeholders' needs.

Each of these roles plays a vital part of each pod at HX and together
they form a strong core, enabling the pod to function efficiently and
effectively.

Agile Process
-------------

Every pod within the web team uses an agile approach which aims to
deliver work quickly in an incremental pattern. This has become common
practice as the flaws of older methodologies, like the waterfall model,
have been highlighted by the adaptive and reactive nature of modern
technology.

### Sprint Structure

At HX this process manifests as fortnightly sprints which aim to be a
self-enclosed two-week section of work.

{{{{{ Sprint Diagram }}}}}

#### Sprint Planning

Most pods in the web team use JIRA to keep track of tickets and will
store a backlog of all the tasks they need to eventually do. This
backlog is used when planning out exactly what should be done for the
next two-week sprint. Tickets are discussed and pulled in to the
upcoming sprint according to the priority given the by the PO, whilst
engineers and testers discuss what is realistically achievable.

#### Development, Testing and Deployment Stage

This stage of the cycle acts as a continuous workflow where every day
the pod will meet to discuss progress. Development, testing and
deployment could happen many times within a single sprint as this step
repeats as increments of work get finished.

Once an engineer feels their work is complete they'll put their work
into a pull request. This is an opportunity for other members of the
team to review the work and ensure its fit for purpose and the code
looks of an acceptable quality. Any feedback given will need to be taken
on board with appropriate changes made until the code is accepted.

After a successful review a ticket will move on to be tested. The
testers of the pod will ensure that the code works in a range of
scenarios and across different environments, including mobile and
desktop. If the code fails to meet requirements in one way or another it
will be returned to the engineer to fix, in which case the entire pull
request review process has to happen again. Once accepted the change
will usually be deployed by the tester, who may also test it works in
staging and shortly thereafter production. At this point the change will
be visible to live customers on our website, which is why there is so
much emphasis placed on the testing before deployment.

#### Mid-Sprint Review

During this iterative deployment approach work will be deployed
frequently so some pods find a mid-sprint meeting beneficial. This
meeting is used to look back on the progress that has been made so far,
evaluate any blockers, issues and whether the sprint is still
achievable. In some cases, work will be removed from the sprint to align
priorities that need to be completed, or extra tickets could be pulled
in if the sprint is going better than expected. The agile coach will
play an important balancing game during these meetings to ensure the
sprint stays in equilibrium.

#### Post-sprint Demo

This meeting is hosted by the whole pod at the end of a sprint and is a
presentation of progress to the stakeholders of the pod. It can be a
valuable time to gather feedback from those who are directly in charge
of what is being worked on.

#### Post-sprint Retrospective (retro)

The concluding meeting of each sprint is the retrospective session that
evaluates the sprint as a whole, discussing what went well as a pod and
what didn't. The agile coach will often prepare unique ways to run this
meeting, but the goal is ultimately the same; to get everyone talking
honestly and sharing their opinions. From the back of these meetings the
pod should make adjustments in the future sprints to improve.

What's it actually like?
------------------------

In many ways Holiday Extras does manage to live up to its ethos and
start-up vibe. Even without having worked anywhere else I can still
recognise the uniqueness of the workplace. The entire open plan office
has an air of friendliness where the atmosphere stays relaxed, and
everyone is approachable. This really helped me in my early days when I
was adjusting and settling in to the office. The ability to go to anyone
in the web team for help in such an easy and inviting environment really
sped up my initial learnings. I feel thankful to have had that
opportunity when I needed it most.

![](media/image3.tiff){width="5.263888888888889in"
height="3.111111111111111in"}And if the office wasn't fun enough as is
there are also plenty of events organised for the team. As early as my
first week with HX we were outside playing tennis and eating
strawberries with cream to celebrate Wimbledon.

These events have continued throughout my time here including recent
bushcraft, human foosball and rounders events. It's been really
refreshing to attend these just to get out of the constant work mode and
get to know colleagues better.

Besides the organised events there are often impromptu goings on and
treats hosted for us. For example, we were given mince pies around
Christmas, our own Easter eggs at Easter and frequent free ice cream
throughout the summer. It's nice to receive these little boosts
throughout the day and further shows the uniqueness of the HX workplace.

We also have the hosted 'shout outs' every Thursday afternoon where
directors or even the CEO himself will update us on the business'
progress, our success against the budget, any new starters, leavers and
more. Another key feature is the calling out cards which are essentially
nominations given by co-workers for notably displaying the HX values. I
can remember being called out as part of the Customer Experience pod and
appreciating the recognition and gratitude for my work. It helps make
hard work feel worthwhile when it's noticed and appreciated.

Another element of HX that makes it stand out is the Project Lounge (PL)
Fridays. These occur fortnightly and offer an entire day just for
personal development or working on a project. It's great to be given
this free reign and have the ability to make a difference through
creative ideas. I benefitted hugely from these during the start of my
placement since I could spend an entire day digging into HX's technology
and frameworks. I've continued to enjoy PL time throughout the year and
have found the time beneficial to my own development.

In summary, I've found the culture at HX has really aided my overall
development throughout this year. My technical skills have been improved
because of how comfortably I can approach people and gain insight
easily. Whilst my personal skills have improved tenfold, especially
moulded by office chatter and special social events helping me network
with colleagues.

Timeline
--------

![](media/image4.png){width="7.956944444444445in"
height="3.3361111111111112in"}The timeline below shows an overview of
which pods I spent my time in, as well as a few of the most notable
events. Most of which will be detailed in the rest of the report.

Onboarding
==========

When joÂ­ining HX there is an initial three-month onboarding period in
which a basic set of objectives must be achieved to ensure you're fit
for the company. This period had a high focus on our individual learning
as Industrial Placement Students (IPs).

Workshops were hosted for us every Tuesday and Thursday which provided
us with knowledge about Node, git, frameworks like React and specific
platforms at HX. Some of the earliest sessions were quite basic but
still gave insight into HX's context. I can also remember them ramping
up in complexity, with a talk by Mark Fermor about containerisation
being overly technical so early in the year. Looking back, my start at
HX would have been a lot slower without these classes at the beginning.

Weekly 1-2-1s
-------------

Throughout onboarding, I had to meet with my manager on a weekly basis
for what HX calls a 1-2-1. Initially this made me nervous, coming from
no work experience I'd never had a manager to report to before. However,
after my first 1-2-1 I realised there was nothing to fear as it was
fairly casual. They felt like more of a catch-up with gentle guidance
around benefitting more from my onboarding period.

Looking back, I can recognise that these sessions helped me
considerably. Before joining HX I struggled to reflect and envision ways
I could develop myself as an individual. This is why I came into my year
with simplistic goals about just gaining experience in the industry. It
was the realisations that I came to in my reflective 1-2-1 sessions that
highlighted areas I could focus my efforts and improve. I remember
discussing my communication weaknesses early on and being able to
evidence improvements just weeks later. The short cycle between these
meetings proved extremely useful as it enabled me to evaluate progress
and improve quickly.

Pod Rotations
-------------

Following my first introductory week I spent three weeks rotating into
different pods, gaining insight into what they each did and how they
worked. This also offered a good opportunity to get to meet other
members of the team, building up a repertoire of familiar faces. As part
of this experience our manager has us present our findings to himself
and the other IPs at the end of each rotation. This helped use to share
in each other's learning as well as practice our presentation skills.

### New Products 

For my first rotation I spent a week with the new products pod. As the
name suggests, they focus on creating new ventures outside of the
traditional core products. This involves all steps from
conceptualisation, creation, market launch and maintenance. Some of
their successful products include rental car hire, resort transfers and
FastTrack passes, even if those passes were sold at cost price for the
first 6 weeks.

During my time with new products I managed to get my hands stuck in and
helped work on some tickets whilst also being exposed to more of the
sprint process. Just within my first two days they had an end of sprint
demo to their stakeholders, followed the next day by the planning of the
upcoming sprint. At first, it felt strange to be attending these
meetings, but they were very accommodating and didn't expect much from
me, it was more to give me the experience and see what they were like. I
appreciate the exposure that I gained from this when I look back on it.

### API 

Having gotten to grips with the work I was given in the new products pod
and beginning to understand the sprint process I was excited coming into
my week with the API pod, especially seeing as it had the potential to
be more technical than what I'd seen so far.

During the week that I spent with the API pod they were fairly far into
a large project called Thunderbird. This project aimed to merge together
our UK booking system with its German counterpart so that we had a
single central platform, rather than having a difficult to expand
system-per-country. The unified result of this project would make it
much easier to globalise HX's business.

To achieve this, we would spend time every day at 2pm comparing 'diffs'
between responses from live systems and the experimental unified system.
Over time this would highlight every difference there is until the
responses are always the same. I enjoyed being involved with this work
as it was a team exercise, with everyone trying to investigate and
figure out what needed tweaking. This helped me improve my group
communication which I'd already started to identify as a weaker area.

![](media/image5.png){width="2.5708661417322833in"
height="2.188976377952756in"}I also managed to get my hands on some
quite technical work. The pod already had a system for generating diffs
for the responses from each system and asked me to expand this for
NOMREP files. Having no idea what that meant George Bates explained to
me that these files were essentially transactional logs in tab-separated
format. By the end the week I successfully implemented a diff process
which produced readable output in the browser with coloured
highlighting, shown below.

I was pleased to get my hands on a challenging ticket with the pod due
to my concern about whether the placement would be technical enough. It
had me re-assured that there would still be plenty of complexity on
offer.

### Customer Experience

My final rotation was into the customer experience (CEX) pod which felt
like a strange choice in this process, seeing as they would be my first
permanent pod. I would have preferred the opportunity to be immersed
into another pod's work to broaden my horizons further. Despite this I
still managed to enjoy the week getting to know my future colleagues and
gaining a head start into working with them.

I spent the majority of my time paired up with Tom Price who as an ex-IP
was quick to offer me assistance, running me through CEX's projects as a
whole and helping with my first ticket. This helped kickstart my week
and lead me to complete a few tickets with a reasonable level of
independence. All of which boosted my confidence in my technical ability
at this early stage. I even received direct feedback from Tom about
this:

> *"When he was on rotation we had some small tasks within render, I
> started to explain to him how the system fits together but he had
> already figured it out before I was finished speaking." *
>
> *-- Tom Price*

One of the tickets was the re-design of the CARE login page, which is
used daily by the Call Centre (CC) staff and hadn't been changed for a
while. This ticket stands out to me because I worked on it during one of
CEX's CC sit-in days, where we would work from desks within the CC. Due
to this I was able to prepare a few designs and actually go and collect
opinions from the CC staff about which one they preferred. Initially the
surveying was quite intimidating, but Han offered to support me, and it
ended up going quite well. I feel that this ticket was extremely
beneficial to me as it showed the importance of the design stage, as
well as communicating with the consumer at the earliest opportunity.

### Finishing off

As the onboarding period drew to a close it was time to prepare for my
review with my manager, aiming to prove that I had achieved the
necessary objectives. Most of this was done based on feedback collected
through the 360 system, which is used to gather opinions from
colleagues. I luckily received a lot of great feedback from the people
I'd worked with closely and those who'd seen me during rotations. On top
of this, I discussed the improvements in my communication over a short
course of time, which Luke agreed with also.

After successfully passing onboarding we were welcomed to the team in
the week's shoutout where we were each given a HX hoodie and bottle of
champagne. It felt nice to be invited into the team with this
announcement as a recognition of a good start.

Customer Experience
===================

Having already spent a week with CEX during my onboarding rotations my
actual joining of this pod didn't feel hugely ceremonious. Although I
was still glad to start settling into my long-term pod, saying goodbye
to the learning intensive onboarding period.

Background
----------

The customer experience pod (CEX) are focussed around fixing
customer-raised issues and enhancing their interactions with us, as well
as supporting operations in the call centre. In a realistic world, the
vagueness of what can improve a customer's experience leaves some odd
work filtering down to the pod. A main focus during my time was to
encourage customers to self-serve rather than relying on the call centre
for support.

### People

The pod had a fairly typical structure and process according to the
agile process I've already described earlier (2.2), originally
consisting of:

-   Mark Cridland (Product Manager)

-   Han Cork (Agile Coach)

-   Becky Cox (50% Tester)

-   Jamie Matthews (Tester)

-   Mike Holloway (Remote Engineer - UK)

-   Adrian Kateliev (Remote Engineer -- Bulgaria)

-   Kiril Panchev (Remote Engineer -- Bulgaria)

-   Tom Price (Engineer -- UK)

The people within the pod ended up changing far more frequently than it
should have due to re-structures, resignations and maternity leave.
Therefore, I'm not going to detail every change to this and instead only
mention some that made a pivotal difference in my year.

What I did
----------

During my time in the pod I managed to pick up quite varied work as was
the nature of CEX's tickets. I found this useful as a new starter since
it gave me a good breadth of knowledge about areas across the business.
Having said that, I still managed to find opportunities gain deep
knowledge in certain areas through projects that I took the lead on.

The broader areas of my work in the pod involved picking up tickets on
Render, which was a front-end platform we were the owners of. This means
that we had some semblance of responsibility for maintenance, enforcing
best practices and playing a role in the bigger decisions surrounding
its future. We also consistently worked with HAPI, which is HX's own API
for handling bookings, product lookups, supplier info and other data
retrieval to support other platforms. There were also projects further
from the core that we worked on including gabble, hammertime and some of
our own purpose built microservices.

I also managed to get involved with some larger projects during my time
in the pod. Including the Booking History Service which was a 2-3 month
project that started as early as my second sprint. This project and
others that I worked on are detailed in the [Projects](#Projects)
section of this report.

Notable events
--------------

During my time with the pod there were a few key events that shaped my
experience, highlighting my strengths and weaknesses throughout the ups
and downs.

### Void of Tom Price

After only one day of officially joining the pod it was announced Tom
Price would be moving as they needed his resources in the PII pop-up
pod. This shook some of the confidence I'd built as Tom was one of the
people I'd worked closest with so far. I was worried about now being the
only non-remote engineer within the pod, especially trying to fill in
where Tom's vast knowledge was.

I knew I had one week left with Tom around and had the easiest access to
him in the office, therefore I turned his departure into an opportunity
to cement myself within the pod. I spent the rest of the week working
with him and arranged a full handover on the Friday, where he ran me
through all of the work he was in the middle of including handing over
PRs directly to me. I tried to gather as much knowledge as possible to
carry forth for the pod's benefit. This settled my nerves a little and
left me feeling comfortable as what I was calling the "Budget Tom
Price". I was further re-assured during my next 1-2-1 where Mark and Han
had fed back to Luke the value they saw in my initiative and investment
here.

### Welcoming of Jordan Clague

Jordan joined the pod just before Christmas and I took charge of
spending time getting him up to speed. We spent all of the day together,
with about two hours dedicated to talking through what the pod does, who
is involved and what projects we have. Moving on to helping him setup
codebases and getting him through his first ticket.

Looking back, this provided a lot of value to me. It helped me see how
much I had improved with my communication in a mentoring scenario that I
hadn't really experienced before. I've also received good feedback from
Jordan about this:

> *"John was the pod member who walked me through my pod\'s previous
> (and current) work when joining the pod and sat with me as I worked on
> my first ticket and set up numerous systems. At the time, I wouldn\'t
> have assumed John was an IP due to how confident / assured John was."
> *
>
> *- Jordan*

This feedback amplified the experience and proved that my focus on
improving my communication was paying off. I appreciated the opportunity
to gain experience as a mentor.

Thoughts and feelings
---------------------

The time I spent with CEX was extremely valuable. It shaped me a lot as
an early engineer and helped highlight my initial strengths and
weaknesses, which I managed to work on and significantly improve during
my service. Especially my communication skills, the easy-going nature of
my fellow pod members really helped me come out of my shell.

The varied opportunities that this pod provided also gave me a lot of
broad knowledge at an early stage which was extremely useful. Thanks to
the mostly self-driven booking history project I managed to learn a lot
on the microservice architecture at HX. Whilst the work for the CC and
direct customers helped expand my front-end skills in a range of
different systems.

I've always said that CEX would have been a fantastic permanent pod if I
was at HX as a full-time engineer. The work isn't always exciting but
the people in the pod made it an absolute blast, with many a fun pod
lunch had. However, due to the fact I was at HX on placement I believe I
could have benefitted more from moving pods earlier. By the time I'd
stayed in the pod for 5 or 6 months the majority of the work became
trivial to complete and didn't teach me much. I would have appreciated a
chance to experience another pod and learn even more.

Overall, my time with CEX was a great experience. I feel that it is a
fantastic pod to start with due to the variety of work that is completed
across many projects. It's a great way to develop a broad understanding
of HX systems. Even though my work in the pod eventually felt stale the
people I was surrounded with made it all worthwhile and kept it
enjoyable. I'm thankful for how the team aspects contributed to my
communication skills and the broad initial education CEX gave me, all of
which have helped me going forwards.

Tech Foundations (Dev stream)
=============================

My move to Tech Foundations felt long overdue, I'd become stale in CEX
and was extremely excited for the change. Especially being invited
closer to the back-end where I always envisioned myself.

During the week that I joined the pod was being split into three
streams. The original Tech Foundation pod grew large and had multiple
separate focuses, therefore it was split into Dev Foundations, UI
Foundations and Data Foundations. The specific stream I've been focused
in is Dev Foundations.

Background
----------

The Dev foundations stream focuses on helping other engineers ship code
quickly and with the best processes possible. This is achieved by
providing easy access to infrastructure and purpose-built tool sets,
especially in the form of the microservice architecture.

The microservice architecture and all of the tools surrounding it are
actually the biggest single focus of the pod. Throughout my time with DF
almost everything we've been working on has revolved around maintaining,
improving and expanding our offering to the team. This included our own
in-house self-built CI service, dockyard-deploy scripts, dockyard-tools
like dockyard-rpc and many others.

### People

This pod had an atypical structure compared to the rest of HX. We didn't
have an individual Product Manager and Agile Coach, instead we had Steve
who acted as a role somewhere in between. Our entire structure was:

-   Steve Coppin-Smith ("Pod Lead")

-   Oliver Rumbelow (Engineer)

-   Mark Fermor (Site Reliability Engineer)

-   Khusro Jaleel (Site Reliability Engineer)

This list is quite a bit shorter than what I laid out as a 'normal' pod
at HX earlier in this report. Not only did we have Steve as an overall
pod lead, we lacked a tester and two members of the team had a unique
SRE role.

The SRE role has a deep focus on the infrastructure behind what we offer
to the rest of the team. They are in charge of technical setup,
maintenance and management of our staging and production environments,
the processes of deployment to them and some of the steps in between. In
all truth, they had a wide-ranging set of responsibilities due to how
important the infrastructure was as part of our microservice offering.

The Engineers in the pod (Myself and Oli) were focused on the areas
which required larger portions of code written. This mainly covered
tools and interfaces between the engineers and the infrastructure we
were providing.

I feel that I actually landed in a unique position within the pod. I was
really the only engineer that had recently worked on the other side of
the coin, consuming all of these tools rather than creating. As well as
the fact I maintained a social connection with engineers from the rest
of the business. This meant that I was surrounded by people full of
feedback on the tools we were providing, and I had a good grasp on
features that they wanted offered. I found it extremely useful to be
able to bring these viewpoints to the pod, applying it to the work I
undertook.

### Process

The process within dev foundations was a complete contrast to what I had
experienced in CEX and how the majority of the web team operates. We
didn't use Jira to keep track of tickets, our only big meetings were
bi-weekly demos and there was less dictation from above. Every engineer
in the pod functioned with a lot of autonomy, taking control of the
entire lifecycle of tasks from identification, design, implementation,
deployment and maintenance. As long as what we were doing provided value
against our current quarterly OKRs we could decide almost entirely solo
what to work on.

Having come from a pod where stakeholders chose exactly what they wanted
done each sprint this was a completely new experience. It initially took
some getting used to, it's hard to start self-identifying what needs to
be improved without an initial grasp on some of this tech. Luckily,
Steve was aware of this and during the early days he had Oli help me
find things to do. Over time I settled in to the approach and became
great at self-organising within the pod, keeping all possible tasks on a
to-do list in slack.

What I did
----------

The tooling we offered to engineers was comprised of various different
services, scripts and codebases, meaning that I managed to gain
experience in a wide spanning set of projects. Especially encouraged by
the self-driven nature of the work where I could find and improve any
aspect of the process.

Some of the codebases that I worked with most frequently were the
ci-service, infrastructure-service and access-service. Although outside
of larger projects I've managed to delve into many areas, including
scripts written to automate annoying tasks. One example of this was a
script I wrote to audit exactly which version of the node-toolbox was
being used across all 100+ microservices. This helped us know who was
far out of date and would come into issues as we needed to release
critical updates.

Outside of the smaller improvements and fixes made across all codebases
I also had some key areas of focus. The two most notable examples are
the access-service and dependency graphing projects that I worked on,
both of which are detailed in my projects section.

Notable events
--------------

I felt my time within dev foundations was actually a lot less eventful
than CEX in terms of people or process changes. It contrasted hugely
from CEX where It felt that every new sprint came with a new
resignation, pod member leaving or completely new faces joining. There
was only one event that actually stands out in dev foundations.

### Steve's sudden resignation

Steve's resignation came in extremely short notice and was a shock to
all but his closest friends. He spoke to us privately on the day of the
announcement to explain some of his reasoning before almost disappearing
within the same day. I didn't see this coming even though I'd personally
observed some of the areas that frustrated him, including the
bastardised agile process that was too far from the original agile
manifesto for his liking. He'd done an amazing job of applying a more
barebones process to our pod, but the business wouldn't let this
approach be adopted further which frustrated him.

I was initially concerned about the pod without Steve, but he had made
us highly autonomous in a way that would allow us to continue without
him. So far, we've clearly managed to prove that we're capable of this
to our stakeholders as we still operate without a pod lead to this day.

Throughout this experience I've still managed to continue delivering and
supporting my teammates, which is a testament to how the year has shaped
me so far. It shows the level of confidence, self-organisation and drive
I've developed to be able to continue to thrive in such an autonomous
workflow.

Thoughts and feelings
---------------------

Overall, I feel that DF has given me exactly the technical challenge I
was looking for. It's been an incredible experience to work alongside
such talented engineers and gain insight into the deeper world of
infrastructure. I've benefitted hugely in terms of knowledge but also
the confidence it's given me, being able to hold my own even surrounded
by some of HX's most experienced engineers. I have faith in myself, my
work and the rest of my career in this area thanks to the opportunity.

I've felt especially lucky to work with Mark and gain insight into his
deeply technical world. He's willingly taken me under his wings to show
me about containerisation, kubernetes and cloud architecture. All of
which play a hugely important part in our systems and many of those in
use in the modern world outside of HX. I'm happy to have had the
opportunity to learn so much about modern infrastructure that's being
used globally.

Projects
========

Whilst quite a lot of my work was typical day-to-day based business as
usual tickets I have also been involved a variety of projects. This
section will detail some of the key projects that I felt shaped my year
and made substantial contributions to my development.

Booking History
---------------

One of my earliest projects was the new booking history service, this
was handed over to me from Tom Price and ended up being my sole focus
for my first few months at HX.

The booking history service aimed to form a centralised source of
booking information. Before it's conception booking data was siloed in
to a few different data stores across platforms, making it hard to
retrieve a holistic set of booking data. The pre-existing method to look
up bookings involved talking directly to CHIPS, the legacy booking
platform at the centre of our operations. Besides limitations in the
expandability here, as CHIPS is maintained externally, it's also an
unnecessary load added to an outdated platform that won't always handle
it gracefully.

####  {#section-1 .ListParagraph}

With this aim in mind the solution took the form of a microservice using
our in-house architecture, which consisted of tools that aimed to make
it simple for engineers to create, deploy and maintain smaller
individual projects. This contrasts hugely with some of HX's core
projects, like HAPI, which were monolithic projects with little
separation of responsibilities. The booking history service would become
one of the early adopters of our microservice architecture. It was
exciting to be building on top of technology that was brand new to HX at
the time.

The overall design of the service included listening to events from our
in-house data pipeline and populate a MySQL database with the
information provided. The pipeline provided a way of sending and
receiving events, where we would be relying on the "server\_ecommerce"
event being sent when a booking is made. We would need to listen for
these events and extract data from them, which would be stored into the
database.

### Challenges

Whilst the design of this service made it seem simple there ended up
being quite a few challenges along the way. Some of which stemmed from
my lack of experience but equally there were issues that some
experienced engineers struggled to explain.

Initially my biggest challenges were getting to grips with NodeJS, the
unique microservice implementation at HX and especially the asynchronous
nature of this application. All of which are things I hadn't dealt with
at great length before. All things considered, I would say this ended up
going quite well. It only took me a few weeks to be running with this
project and have a good grasp about the main concepts employed. The
confidence gained here helped me to feel comfortable with being at the
forefront of a big project so early on at HX. I'm thankful for the
opportunity to have been trusted so early on.

#### Duplicate Events

There came a more serious challenge when we seemed to be receiving
duplicate events from the data pipeline. This was detrimental to the
service as it had the potential to pollute the data, creating
inconsistencies that would be unfavourable when trying to create the
single source of truth about bookings. So much so that it actually ended
up being a focus for an entire month. I had to spend a lot of time
investigating the exact cause of the duplication and struggled to come
up with anything. I can remember looping in more experienced engineers,
including those who created the data pipeline and the microservice
architecture and none of them had an answer for me either.

Eventually my suspicions lead to there being a deeper issue within
CHIPS, moreover surrounding the webhooks that CHIPS sends to our systems
when a booking is made. This would fall on the external Chauntry team to
be fixed, but unfortunately, they were completely occupied with the
ongoing thunderbird project. This meant that the problem wouldn't be
fixed at its core for a long while, we had to work our way around this.

My original proposed solution was to implement a cache for the service.
This involved caching every booking that we received, as well as
checking the cache before ever storing a booking. This *should* have
allowed us to eliminate duplicate entries from ever being allowed to
enter the database. I discussed this with various engineers around the
business before starting it and everyone agreed that it was a sensible
solution. However, once this had been implemented and tested it proved
to be only partially effective. This puzzled me for a few days, as well
as the engineers I spoke to about it. On paper and during local testing
this change was undeniably a suitable solution. However, it just didn't
behave correctly in production, we suspected this was to do with the
fact the service ran across multiple instances in production causing a
race condition. At this point I'd become frustrated with the project, I
constantly kicked myself for not being able to provide a perfect
solution.

Finally, I concluded that nothing right now could solve the duplicate
event issue on the ingested data. Therefore, I decided to fix the issue
by restructuring the database. It would now accept multiple entries for
a single booking, but when requested we would **only** provide the most
recent information. This didn't feel very clean, but it was the only
true solution on the table in the time frame, especially with the
Chauntry team being completely occupied.

#### Stakeholder Pressure

During the difficulty with the duplicated events there was also pressure
from above, our stakeholders were struggling to understand the value of
booking history due to the time it was taking. I took this upon myself
and spoke to all of the people I knew who were waiting for it to be
ready. I got them all to send me the reasoning behind what they wanted
and why, providing this to Mark and Han to help them convince the
stakeholders. I received feedback from both of them that they really
appreciated the initiative I showed, and it helped a lot with pursuing
the project to completion. This lifted my spirits and helped me get back
on track instead of being in a rut of frustration.

### Thoughts and feelings

This project came very early in my placement at HX and provided me with
a good set of learning opportunities, especially surrounding the
microservice architecture at HX. I believe that it really helped me
build confidence early on and establish myself within the pod and the
wider web team.

I was quite lucky to start with microservices as they are self-contained
and don't come with years of legacy bundled into them, making the
initial understanding much easier. This sped up my early progress and
enabled me to showcase my abilities to the pod, building their
confidence in me owning this project. I don't think an entire
experienced pod would put this in my hands at this stage had I not been
able to prove my confidence.

At the same time, this project wasn't without it's difficulties.
Throughout all of the problems described I noticed that I picked myself
apart too much. I can remember frequent drives home during the duplicate
issues where I would kick myself for not solving it that day. This
frustration wasn't beneficial to anybody and would only put my mental
state in a rut. In future I should be more aware that this negativity
doesn't actually help, instead focusing on things in a different more
positive light. Especially considering this was a problem that
experienced engineers couldn't figure out and agreed with my proposals
on.

Reviews
-------

Towards the end of my time in CEX I got involved with a project to make
our reviews more transparent and clear. Mainly, our stakeholders wanted
us to base our ratings and displayed reviews off of the last two years
of data. Previously reviews were historical from the date of the
product's conception, which meant that if it had been changed recently
it would be hard for that to be reflected in reviews.

Towards the end of my time in the pod I got involved with investigating
issues surrounding reviews on the website. Our stakeholders wanted us to
only show reviews that were within the past two years, rather than since
the products conception. Sounds simple enough, right?

Unfortunately, this ended up being a complicated issue riddled with
challenges caused by legacy tech. I spent a lot of time with Ricardo,
who had experience with the original system, digging deeper into where
reviews come from and how they're stored. The information was collected
via surveys sent to customers after their trips, it included a basic
rating of the product, rating of HX and any comments they might have.
All of which was fine as a collection source, however the way the
database that stored this had been designed was not fit for our purpose.

Rather than containing a persistent store of all reviews the database
stored a calculated result which was deleted and replaced daily by a
cron job. The fact that this was an overwriting operation and
continuously erased previous data there was no easy way for us to just
query for two years of data. I ended up working closely with Adrian on
this and we tried to create a second table containing summaries for two
years of data. This began to work sort of as expected, but it also
exposed some deeper underlying issues with the way reviews were
originally created.

Due to these complications I ended up having to leave the pod without
finishing the project. This was disappointing, it's not easy to walk
away from a project and not have closure on it. I did manage to reduce
the frustration of this by arranging a handover to Jordan who'd joined
the pod two months prior. I have since seen him carry the project to
completion, which laid the project to rest once and for all in my mind.

Overall, I feel that this project actually went reasonably well. There
were issues with the legacy tech and the archaic database design but, it
eventually was solved with the help of my investigation and partial
solution. I think one of the key results was also how it helped
establish me across the wider team rather than just my pod. This was
shown by the fact that I became the "go to guy" for a while on this
subject, especially when Ricardo, who I originally sought help from,
started sending people to me. It was also a final proof for my
communication-based objectives at the time, since there were a lot of
new faces involved seeking updates, explanations and discussions
from/with me.

Microservice Re-homing
----------------------

Ever since the earliest design of microservices they've been imagined as
belonging to a specific team, we call these owners. This ownership is
significant for who maintains and takes responsibility for each service,
whilst also correlating to significance in the architecture running
them. This originally meant that from point of conception this owner was
set in stone, due to the declarative infrastructure supporting them
which wasn't easy to move around.

However, with the businesses shift towards shorter-term mission-based
pods which could come and go dynamically, there would be issues with the
long-term ownership model. With this now becoming more necessary I took
charge of investigating the possibility of re-homing services.

I spent time plotting out all different dependent areas which stored and
relied on information about who the owner was. I narrowed it down to
this list:

-   Grafana Dashboard

-   Github Teams

-   Package.json

-   Sumologic collectors

-   Database instances

I then explored the APIs for each of these areas and managed to build a
proof-of-concept script for almost all of them, showing that re-homing
would be a definitely possibility. The only thing that seemed more
difficult was re-allocating the databases, which I've detailed further
in the challenges section.

Having shown the pod my initial investigation into this they were happy
with my evidence that re-homing would be possible, although it was never
going to be easy. I stepped forward and started working on it right
away, turning my proof-of-concept into a fully-fledged process. I
appreciated that the pod had enough trust to leave this in my hands even
though I'd only been with the pod for a few months.

Eventually, I had the entire script built and working as an RPC endpoint
in the access service. I spent time testing this before taking it to our
demo and proudly showing the stakeholders what I'd achieved. It felt
great to be able to tackle real problems for the pod and have a large
impact.

I was also tasked with making a workplace post about the project. I had
this edited by Steve and he had nothing but praise for the writing, and
the post seemed well received by the web team. This was a nice
confirmation of my written communication and helped prove that I had
improved in these areas. It also boosted my recognition across the web
team as now everyone comes to me for all things access-service and
service re-homing. It's nice to receive appreciation for work that I've
achieved and knowing it's having the desired impact.

### Challenges

Throughout the project the complications of database re-homing loomed
over my head. In the initial design of microservices lead to there being
a database instance per pod, which hosted a database per-service within
it. The diagram below explains this structure a little further:

This shows that all databases are grouped into an overall database
instance that is created per-team. Meaning that to move a database's
ownership it has to be transferred from one instance to another, which
is complicated and leaves practically unavoidable downtime during the
move.

I spent some time drafting ideas on a way to write a completely
down-time free moving mechanism, but it was extremely complex. I
arranged one or two meetings with the pod to discuss this around a
whiteboard. In these sessions we eventually agreed that it was too much
investment at this point. Instead settling with leaving the databases
for how they are. There's no technical limitation that means the
databases **have** to be moved, but with a multi-tenancy instance setup
there can be negative effects. For example, if one of the services on
the instance has an extremely busy database and the load is too much all
co-tenant databases could be affected. This is why they were originally
grouped by team, it would be the team's own fault if their other
databases were affected. We'd now be leaving it up to luck which
databases are co-tenants on each instance. One day we might come back to
this if it becomes an issue but it's functional as is for now.

### Thoughts and Feelings

This project stands out as one of the more impactful things I got to do
at HX. It completely changed the previous approach to microservice
ownership, shifting the singular responsibility into dynamic
responsibility across the web team, leaving pods open to pick up and own
services fluidly.

Due to the fact this was one of my earlier pieces of work in dev
foundations it also established my place as a vital contributor.
Building this trust and respect within the pod has proved useful ever
since, being able to confidently speak my mind and know the pod will
fully consider what I say. It's fair to say this could have been much
harder without opportunities like this, especially being surrounded by
engineers with vastly more experience than me in an extremely technical
pod.

I also managed to demonstrate my problem solving and decision-making
skills throughout the investigative stages of the project. Especially
when I took the initiative to host meetings to discuss the database
problem.

Overall, I feel this project was valuable to the business and even more
worthwhile for my own development. I got to independently experience a
complex issue all the way from investigation, design and final
implementation. Carrying a project like this through from start to
finish on my own so early in my career reassures my confidence and trust
in myself.

Dependency Graphing
-------------------

Seeing as we have over 100 microservices deployed into our live
environments it can be hard to keep track of, especially for the
majority of services that communicate with each other via RPC. There had
been quite a few expedites recently in which confusing
cross-communication had obscured where the issue was coming from, and as
such we needed to provide something to help engineers understand what's
actually going on.

To do this I took up a challenge of mapping out all communications that
are occurring via RPC. Luckily, all services which use RPC do so through
the node-toolbox, which we created, meaning I could be certain that the
metrics would be stored for all of these requests. This made my life
easier as the data was already prepared in a suitable format, I just had
to work on pulling it out of Prometheus and displaying it for users.

I spent a while investigating which graphing tools we could use
including CLI tools, online APIs and actual modules. Steve was pushing
for me to learn and use D3, but the learning curve seemed too steep for
it to actually be worthwhile. I sought alternatives and found a
dependency wheel tool that could generate a D3 dependency wheel for me.
The result of this can be seen below:

![](media/image6.tiff){width="5.447222222222222in"
height="4.554166666666666in"}

> (Each service could be hovered to obscure the other lines for clarity)

At this point Steve chatted to me and he had envisioned more capability
from the graph, rather than just showing exactly which services are
communicating. He continued to push for a D3 graph, but I refuted that
it was necessary, even questioning whether this was becoming more of a
vanity project not worth the time investment. However, I was convinced
that we could gain value from showing more information especially as a
live graphic, I just didn't believe D3 was necessary.

I sought alternatives and eventually settled on Vis.js after testing it
to build a simple node graph. This proof-of-concept was proof enough
that the Vis.js library would be suitable, so I moved on to preparing
the data.

The data was in a static format that wasn't necessarily built for live
display which meant I had to be a little creative. I settled for two
different Prometheus queries, one to pull back *ALL* of the RPC events
and another to fetch only the ones that occurred in the last 10 minutes.
I used the exhaustive list of events to build up the structure of the
graph as a holistic view of our systems. I then used the 10-minute data
as a layer on top of the graph to visualise recent traffic, including
colouring lines based on traffic and success rate, and showing a
breakdown of which RPC functions were being called. As shown below:

![](media/image7.tiff){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.6180555555555554in"}

This shows how the final version of the graph looked with each node
being a service, each line representing communication between services,
and colours representing success rates and traffic volume.

I was further asked to do a presentation of this for the backend-guild
and also post about it on workplace. Both of which were well received as
demonstrated by some feedback below:

> *"Good presentation, showcasing the solution and explaining the
> problems it solved. Clear and detailed demonstration of the features
> of the system."* - Pedro Romano

### Thoughts and feelings

I enjoyed the opportunity to take on a more visual-based project for a
bit of a change. I absolutely adore my work in the back-end but it's a
nice variation to have something that's visually measurable and still
serves a technical purpose.

I think the areas I improved the most throughout this work were all
surrounding my business-oriented skills rather than actual technical
abilities. This included my decision making, presentation (evidenced
above) and written communication skills.

The decision making comes from the early push backs on Steve's
desperation for D3, which is something demonstrable from feedback he
gave me on his departure:

> *"Noticing the complexity of the work was growing, John approached me
> to explore and challenge the value, given the growing cost. Just one
> example of when he impressed me in this area." *
>
> -- Steve CS

My written communication was evidenced in a well-received workplace post
I made about the service after it was released, shown in the screenshots
below.

![](media/image8.tiff){width="3.5416666666666665in" height="5.125in"}

Simon Wood in the reply above is one of Dev Foundations' stakeholders so
his response is particularly pleasing.

Overall, I feel that this project offered me a chance to be more
creative whilst still having some technical complexity. It struck a good
balance of front-end visuals and back-end data scraping and
transformation. I really enjoyed combining these skill sets to provide a
tool which people have already told me has shown its value.

Other notable events
====================

HX always aims to move at a fast pace embracing change, so I have seen
my fair share of events over the past year. Including the ongoing
erection of a third office on the Hythe campus. I've detailed some of
the most impactful events below, as well as some personal events that
didn't fit into my singular pod timelines.

Chauntry Acquisition
--------------------

In a shoutout on the 9^th^ of November it was revealed that HX had
acquired our long-standing partner Chauntry. As a company they offer
parking reservation systems and have close ties to over 800 car parks
worldwide. We've been working with them since 1992 as they supply us
with CHIPS, our booking system which is at the core of all of our
technology.

I was initially unsure of the acquisition as our current CHIPS system
feels very legacy and outdated, this move to me signalled that we would
never be moving away from it. When I took a step back and thought about
it I realised we probably would have never migrated anyway, at least now
we'd be in an advantageous position to push for improvements to it.

Purple Parking Acquisition
--------------------------

In a press piece on the 2^nd^ of November it was announced that HX was
taking control of some of Purple Parking's assets and website, following
failure to find a buyer for the entire business. This would allow HX to
utilise Purple Parking's website to continue selling our own products,
maintaining customers that previously had loyalty to Purple Parking. A
pop-up pod was made for about a month to convert the Purple Parking
website to use our backend, allowing us to collect and fulfil all new
bookings being made.

This acquisition seemed like a no-brainer deal for HX. With the
implementation mentioned above we literally started selling our products
via their website, utilising their brand and assets to gain additional
business from Purple Parking's existing customer base. Who would say no?

GDPR Enforcement
----------------

A big legal event for the company was the incoming enforcement of GDPR
as set out by EU regulations. GDPR stands for General Data Protection
Regulation and laid out rules that give customers greater control over
their data usage, including the right to be forgotten.

HX had to work hard to be compliant with these regulations in time for
the enforcement date on the 25^th^ May 2018. I wasn't directly involved
with much of the process, besides a script I started working on to
detect which services could be using customer data. However, there was a
big business push to be compliant on time, especially by the
data-products and data-platform teams.

Conference Day Presentation
---------------------------

HX hosts an internal conference day around every 6 months, inviting all
of the web team to attend talks, presentations and roundtables presented
by colleagues. Myself and Rosie Watson, a fellow IP, were asked to do a
talk about being IPs which we agreed to as it seemed like good way to
wrap-up our year.

boring as a starting point. We instead decided to relate our talk back
to our favourite board game, Articulate, as well as playing a HX version
in our talk. The game focuses on the ability to explain words to
team-mates without using the actual word on the card. We felt this
related well to what it's like to start as an IP, joining into a world
of jargon where things must be deeply broken down for us. We felt this
would relate to other members of the team and help us show what we found
beneficial, so they could improve their articulation going forwards.

Our talk went extremely well, and it boosted my confidence in my
presentation and communication skills, two areas that I'd previously
recognised as weaknesses. We received some lovely feedback that further
confirmed this as shown below:

> *"Great balance between informative and fun" -- Becky Cox*
>
> *"It's very courageous for IPs to stand up and do a talk in front of
> other employees, well done, really enjoyed it." - Nathan Scott*

In the end, I was very glad we took this opportunity as much as it made
me nervous at first. Pushing through and delivering a great talk made it
all worthwhile.

Contract Extension
------------------

Around May 8^th^ I was taken aside for a five-minute chat with my
manager, Luke, not really knowing what to expect. It turned out to be
the good news that they wanted to offer me a contract extension until
August 31^st^. This was wonderful, and it excited me that I would have
the opportunity to continue working at HX throughout the summer. I
signed and accepted his proposal that day and everything was confirmed
by May 14^th^. I've managed to continue on track and keep gaining
experience from the extended time I've been given. I truly appreciate
the recognition and acknowledgement of my skills that this contract
extension is.

Conclusion
==========

Whilst there have absolutely been ups and downs throughout my year the
experience as a whole has been fantastic. I've been given opportunities
to work on a variety of technology stacks taking on challenging tasks,
whilst surrounded by an inviting team of incredible talent.

I came into this year as naive student with no previous work experience
and no clue what to expect, but I came out as a well-rounded engineer
having overcome challenges I never imagined. Part of my naivety was
starting my year with very few goals, mainly focusing on gaining
experience in the industry and confirming that this was the career I
wanted. However, thanks to the help and guidance from my manager I
managed to find more fulfilling goals early on. This included goals
surrounding my self-reflection and communication, which became core
focuses of my time at HX.

As a result of this year my business, communication and technical skills
have all improved tenfold. I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to
work for such a self-development focused company, where constant
feedback has helped me find weaknesses, identify new strengths and
ultimately shaped my growth. If it wasn't for this environment I doubt I
would have gained quite as much as I did during my placement year.

My technical skills have been enhanced through the work that I've done
and the learning opportunities I've taken. I've dabbled in so many
technologies and codebases that I'd never experienced before and
broadened my horizons vastly. My coding abilities on the front and back
end have both substantially improved and I've been able to employ them
in tandem, something I hadn't really tried before. It's helped me hugely
to be able see these areas come together and work as a full stack
developer. My work in Dev Foundations has also given me a wealth of
infrastructural and deep architectural knowledge that I would have never
had otherwise. I'm glad to be walking away with such a vast array of
learnings that I can apply throughout my future.

Communication was one of my weaknesses coming into this year, but I feel
confident in my abilities now. The year has truly pulled me out of my
shell and encouraged me to be comfortable around colleagues in all
contexts. I think that I've adapted well to face-to-face communication
in the office, being more than happy to approach anyone for help when
necessary. As well as learning how to best utilise my written
communication for discussions and knowledge sharing. These improvements
have already helped me to work more constructively, comfortably asking
questions and challenging others when necessary. I believe these skills
will continue to serve me in all aspects of life and push forward my
potential in my career.

One of the biggest things the year has taught me is the importance of
self-reflection. When I first started this was a huge weakness but the
focus my manager helped me place on it really saw it skyrocket. I went
from struggling to explain my feelings in 1-2-1s to coming to them with
a 4-page document, verbosely detailing the work I've done and how I've
felt about all aspects of it. Perhaps this was even too much reflection,
but it was a stark contrast to my earliest months at HX. I feel this
skill has benefitted me in a personal way as well as professionally,
giving me opportunities to look back and analyse how I can improve
myself. This will continue to drive decisions about my career and what
is best for my own development in the future.

Overall, my placement has been nothing short of amazing. The skills that
I've developed will benefit me throughout my final year of university
and far beyond into my career. I'm extremely glad I chose to participate
in the programme and with such a phenomenal employer.
