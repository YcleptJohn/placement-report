# Placement Report - John Taylor [2017-2018]
As part of my Computer Science degree I undertook a placement year, with some of the grading being based on this reflective report. This repository acts as a backup and way of tracking progress during writing. 
  
This report documents my experiences at Holiday Extras from start to finish and focuses on reflecting on the challenges faced, opportunities gained and fears overcome. The main report is all written in **report.docx**, with **report.md** being an automatically converted document. This is provided to enable reading on github without having MS Word, although the formatting may be considerably more difficult.
